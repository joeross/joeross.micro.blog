<p>I understand that for calculation of overtime, my contractual hour rate with <em>Employer</em> is set at minimum wage, which is the wage that New Jersey Department of Labor sets, or the Federal minimum wage, whichever is higher.

			 <p>Sam Cole, <a href="https://www.404media.co/automattic-buyout-offer-wordpress-matt-mullenweg/">writing at <em>404 Media</em></a> about Matt Mullenweg&rsquo;s ongoing, unforced founder mode flameout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We were unaware that Matt redirected sign-up emails until current Automattic employees contacted our support team,” a spokesperson for Blind told me, adding that they’d “never seen a CEO or executive try to limit their employees from signing up for Blind by redirecting emails.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just gross. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine why anyone would still want to work for him now that toxicity is the norm, but he still has fans inside the company:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is a vocal group of sycophants who are cheering on Matt&rsquo;s actions via Anonymattic,&rdquo; [an employee] said, &ldquo;drawing favorable comparisons to how Elon Musk and Donald Trump operate. Their morale seems high, but I can&rsquo;t relate.&rdquo; Screenshots viewed by 404 Media show some staff having changed their Slack usernames to include &ldquo;[STAYING]&rdquo; to signal their support of Mullenweg and intention to remain at the company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing is, whether you agree with him or not, it&rsquo;s not the rhetorical position he has taken that&rsquo;s the problem, it&rsquo;s the way he&rsquo;s expressing and defending that position that is the problem. And it&rsquo;s <em>such</em> a problem that it&rsquo;s hard to see anyone defending his recent behavior as having much of a reputation left after all of this.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://joeross.me/2024/10/05/matt-mullenweg-is.html">said before</a>, I don&rsquo;t envy his/the company&rsquo;s lawyers the job of litigating around his ongoing meltdown. I&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69221176/wpengine-inc-v-automattic-inc/">the filings at CourtListener</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently it’s against terms of service to track prices. There are other apps that do this so it’s a bit surprising. Apparently they’ve given other services permission and I’m trying to see if they will allow DropScout to do this.</p>

			 <p>The 1999 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepy_Hollow_(film)"><em>Sleepy Hollow</em></a> is, to my mind, the film to watch during the transition from early autumn to the Halloween season.</p>
<p>It captures the dreary, de-saturated feeling you get, on the east coast of the U.S., anyway, when you realize there won&rsquo;t be another day without a chill in the air for a few months.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of weirdness and dark humor, but one of my favorite exchanges in the movie is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Ichabod Crane</em></strong>: You have moved the body.<br>
<strong><em>Dr. Thomas Lancaster</em>:</strong> I did.<br>
<strong><em>Crane</em>:</strong> You must never move the body!<br>
<strong><em>Lancaster</em>:</strong> Why not?<br>

<p>But I’m posting to warn anyone who turned the interview off after Jelly Roll inveighed against voting: he walked that back in the final minutes of the podcast episode, which was a second interview session on a different day, telling the interviewer he was just messing with him.</p>
<p>The interviewer was probably right when he half jokingly asked whether the walkback was an attempt at revisionist history, but Jelly Roll jovially denied it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, someone on his team likely told him between interviews that, when you don&rsquo;t want to make political headlines, the only thing worse than endorsing a candidate is telling your millions-strong fanbase that their vote doesn&rsquo;t count&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Laurens Hof, writing in <a href="https://fediversereport.com/last-week-in-fediverse-ep-73-and-72/">Episode 73 of his Last Week in Fediverse newsletter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes the situation with rumours of Mastodon leaking private messages so interesting to me is that the original posts that contained the rumours got significantly more engagement than the corrections. So it seems to me that the structural feature of decentralised networks that ‘significantly limits the reach of fake news’ can also work to limit the reach of corrections to fake news as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good point, but the structural aspect of decentralized networks that makes it as difficult to circulate corrections as it is to circulate fake news is susceptible to some white hat manipulation. To paraphrase a misquote/cliché, we have to be the circulation we wish to see in the network.</p>
<p>Decentralization significantly reduces virality, allowing users to more carefully control the spread of information. We can spread corrections effectively, it just takes effort.</p>
<p>I don’t have a solution, but here’s something ive been thinking about: Perhaps there is some way of building corrections into ActivityPub as a special type of edit that triggers a notification to users who interacted with the original post.</p>
<p>I would advocate for making this mechanism opt-out to maximize the flow of corrections, but I know that may be naïve, and that perhaps I’m ignorant of the likelihood that some would find a way to abuse such a tool to spread fake news after all. It’s a fun thought experiment, and I’m open to discussing with other nerds who think about this stuff at weird hours of the night when they should be sleeping.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m in a weird headspace about the Supreme Court&rsquo;s right wing wearing their partiality on their sleeves. I’m supposed to be mad about it, like lots of liberals. But I think it’s a kind of honesty and, in its hubris, exposes the vulnerabilities of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/09/revolutionary-conservative-legal-philosophy-courts-00069201">the right’s more longterm</a> jurisprudential projects.</p>
<p>(<em>Takes a deep breath, hopes people read all the way through, or at least halfway through&hellip;</em>)</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m talking about the most recent example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/justice-alito-upside-down-flag.html">reported by Jodi Kantor</a> at <em>The New York Times</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judicial experts said in interviews that the flag was a clear violation of ethics rules, which seek to avoid even the appearance of bias, and could sow doubt about Justice Alito&rsquo;s impartiality in cases related to the election and the Capitol riot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been several developments since I first started writing this post in mid-May when the upside flag story first broke. None of those developments changes my perspective. In fact, they all reinforce it. Anyway, to catch up and stay caught up on the Alito/flags stuff and all else SCOTUS, I recommend reading the work of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/profiles/john-fritze">John Fritze at <em>CNN</em></a>, <a href="https://www.lawdork.com">Chris Geidner&rsquo;s <em>Law Dork</em></a>, and the <a href="https://slate.com/tag/supreme-court">SCOTUS team at <em>Slate</em></a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as worked up about this one because it doesn&rsquo;t involve direct or indirect financial incentives, or a spouse inserting themselves, however superfluously, into schemes resembling a coup. And it shouldn&rsquo;t change the assumptions of anyone who has been paying attention to Alito for the past many years. Yes, it&rsquo;s infuriating and concerning and beyond anything I would hope for our highest court. But it&rsquo;s not a surprise.</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t believe he didn&rsquo;t know about the flag hanging <em>outside his house</em>, or its meaning as a sign of solidarity with &ldquo;stop the steal&rdquo; whackos, and of course, blaming your spouse in the national press is&hellip; a choice, and of course &ldquo;my neighbors were teasing me first&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t an appropriate reaction for a Supreme Court justice to the political speech of his neighbors, however performative and counterproductive that speech may be.</p>
<p>But the handwringing over this flag episode is based on the idea that anyone paying attention could take seriously the proposition that Alito lacks bias or could possibly be impartial in cases related to the election and the Capitol riot, or really any issue of importance to, eh, people of his political ilk. Impartial people, and people worried about at least appearing impartial, do not <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/11/at-federalist-society-convention-alito-says-religious-liberty-gun-ownership-are-under-attack/">give the keynote speech</a> at Federalist Society conventions.</p>
<p>(Nor do they <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/05/supreme-court-south-carolina-redistricting-ruling-clarence-thomas-brown-v-board.html">inveigh wholeheartedly against a Constitution protective of the rights of all Americans</a>, but that is beyond the scope of this post…)</p>
<p>Usually, this is where I would admit my own outsize portion of cynicism, and caution Dear Readers to consider this screed in that light, but this time I do the opposite: the fact is, the suggestion that Alito has any impartiality to preserve is, at this point, blatantly dishonest or an inadvertent admission of naïveté. As just one recent example, he openly treats the First Amendment as if it applies to conduct by private companies moderating their users' speech (it does not) and then has to be <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/02/free-speech-internet-big-tech-scotus-case.html">called out on it</a> by Justice Kavanaugh.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;m going to say something (else?) people may not like, and that I may regret someday:</p>
<p>I actually appreciate Alito&rsquo;s intellectual honesty, though query whether it’s deliberate or the result of too much rhetorical laziness to be more insidious about his intentions. Because <em>there are</em> more measured, insidious ways to drag the nation backward, under the guise of faith to the Constitution <em>qua</em> <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/the-history-of-history-and-tradition-the-roots-of-dobbss-method-and-originalism-in-the-defense-of-segregation">“history and tradition”</a>, as close as posible to a time when people who looked like Alito, and me, for that matter, held all the power, and there was no immediate risk of having to share it.</p>
<p>History and tradition, indeed.</p>

<p>Tripp Mickle, Brian X. Chen and Cade Metz report at <em>The New York Times</em> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision came after the executives Craig Federighi and John Giannandrea spent weeks testing OpenAI&rsquo;s new chatbot, ChatGPT. The product&rsquo;s use of generative artificial intelligence, which can write poetry, create computer code and answer complex questions, made Siri look antiquated, said two people familiar with the company&rsquo;s work, who didn&rsquo;t have permission to speak publicly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple can&rsquo;t be serious here. My earliest <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> recipes made Siri look antiquated. Siri has been, to put it as politely as Siri deserves, trash for years. The user experience of the earliest <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo">Echo Auto</a> was head and shoulders above Siri. If you need a reminder set, Siri will work more often than not. But that&rsquo;s been its only viable use case since release.</p>
<p>Apple has been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apples-plans-to-bring-artificial-intelligence-to-your-phone/">marketing off of machine learning since 2018</a> and probably earlier, so it&rsquo;s just bonkers that they didn&rsquo;t decide to scrap Siri at least that long ago and turn their machine learning resources toward something better.</p>

<p>I do wonder if it would have had a brighter future <em>without</em> the ability to add comments. I never engaged with that social aspect of the service, and I expect it contributed massively to its complexity and moderation costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think about this every time a good news or link aggregation app goes away. These apps are, fundamentally, trying to help you sort the signal from the noise in an overwhelming &ldquo;media ecosystem&rdquo; or whatever we&rsquo;re supposed to call it these days.</p>
<p>As soon as they add their own social layer on top of the news and the links, they have betrayed their best use case and their most loyal users. It&rsquo;s like buying a pair of earplugs, only to have them turn into in-ear headphones or hearing aides you don&rsquo;t need and never asked for.</p>
<p>Engagement, which they thought would spike after going social, craters. Resources, which were optimized and sufficient and scalable with increasing revenue over time, are siphoned off, as Jarrod wrote, into moderation and increasingly complex development cycles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of death spiral that most founders notice too late, so kudos, of a sort, to Artifact&rsquo;s founders for knowing the telltale signs of a terminally ill app, and letting it die with some dignity.</p>
<p>There are already plenty of places to share links and half-baked hot takes. The real challenge, for Artifact&rsquo;s founders and anyone else with the leadership, technical and fundraising skills to tackle it, is to build something extremely useful to individuals <em>without draining all of its lifeblood into a push for &ldquo;social&rdquo;</em> that ultimately just turns it into another internet noise machine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Skip and dance, jump and prance! Go down through the orchard and stroll in the woods! The world is a wonderful place when you’re young.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sure is.</p>
<p>What a hell of an amazing book to relegate to the unjustly dismissed &ldquo;children&rsquo;s&rdquo; shelves. This book gets five stars, no question about it.</p>
<p>White manages to address, in my opinion, so many of The Important Things We All Should Learn About Rather Young If Possible, including misogyny/clueless men, bullies, transactional acquaintances, competition, the joy and sorrow of freedom, the dilemma of the naive but intelligent, parenting (well, let&rsquo;s be honest, mostly motherhood), the distinction between pathology and an innocent&rsquo;s rational-from-their-perspective perceptions, the rarity and value of adults who are aware of the immediately preceding concept (like the inimitable Dr. Dorian), evolution, religion, birth and death, and, of course, the intergenerational power of real, no-but-seriously-really-real friendship that reaches out beyond its originators and enriches those who come after, in ways known and unknown, for years or decades to come.</p>
<p>Like I said, just a hell of a book.</p>

			 <p>Here’s a reply I posted to someone I follow on Mastodon who, on being issued an iPhone by their employer for work calls, was wondering why anyone chooses it over other options when, for example, it’s hard to sideload something as simple as a custom ringtone:</p>
<p>Look I need guardrails and I’ve known that ever since I was bopping around the command line on my HTC Evo 4G.</p>
<p>Some of us stopped headbanging not because the music left our hearts, but because if you feel something too deeply for too long it can destroy you.</p>
<p>That’s what was happening to me in the bowels of my root-and-rom addiction.</p>
<p>Now I pay 0.99 for a ringtone to Tim Apple and say thank you sir may I have another because I’m safe from sudo-ing on my phone.</p>

			 <p>I was listening to <a href="https://celesteheadlee.com/">Celeste Headlee</a> interview <a href="https://www.anildash.com/">Anil Dash</a> on the <a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/what-next-tbd/2023/08/techs-white-supremacist-reactionary-problem">latest episode</a> of the Slate podcast <a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/what-next-tbd">What Next: TBD</a>, and Dash said something about the kind of web communities we should build, and encourage, to combat the rise of white supremacy among wealthy and influential tech leaders and the communities they fund:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we make there be a community that has its own recipes and how many of the apps you use every day are home cooked meals made by somebody you love in a community that you’re from? It can be that, it’s happening again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This immediately struck me as a perfect description of what I like about <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://home.omg.lol">Omg.lol</a>. Each is made by a <a href="https://adam.omg.lol/">person</a> or a <a href="https://micro.blog/about">small team</a> who are constantly involved in the community, who we can report bugs to, suggest features to, or just chat with, and who greet criticism head-on with clear explanations of why they hold their positions, and who maintain a willingness to change their minds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re perfect &ndash; after all, like you and I, they&rsquo;re <em>people</em>, so of course they&rsquo;re not perfect. But that&rsquo;s just it: they&rsquo;re <em>people</em>, and they treat their users like they&rsquo;re people, too.</p>
<p>We get all of this because we pay a really, <em>really</em> reasonable fee to join these communities, relieving them of the need to pursue increasingly questionable methods of revenue generation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the web worth paying for, and I&rsquo;m happy to be here.</p>

<p>Matt Corey put together a list of developers holding sales in an indie software version of Amazon’s Prime Day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Below, you&rsquo;ll find a list of over 100 (🤯) Indie apps that are offering discounts for Indie App Sales, July 11-12! Each of these apps is developed by an Indie App Developer - that can mean a lot of different things, but generally speaking, these are built by very small teams, or individuals either full time or part time. Indie App Developers are the epitome of small businesses, and sure do appreciate your support!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A recent study of sleep loss and depression found that one night of total sleep deprivation generally worsens mood and emotional regulation in healthy individuals, but induces a temporary lift in spirits for some individuals with depression.
. . .
The findings were remarkable: lack of sleep escalated negative mood among the healthy subjects, but eased depressive symptoms in 43% of the patients with depression.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The address bar has become our entry point to the internet these days. Firefox in its default configuration does some sort of smart guess on what you type there. If it resembles a URL then the browser makes that request. If not, it sends the string you typed to your default search engine. It also includes some fuzzy search matches from your history and all that, which is fine 90% of the time, but sometimes you need a bit more control over what results it shows you.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780345391810">The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</a> by Douglas Adams.</p>
<p>️Maybe not as ruthlessly original as, well, the original, but better than a Vogon poem.</p>
<p>Let the naysayers say their nays. Sure, it’s no <em>Hitchhikers</em>, but nothing was before, and nothing will be again. Unless we’re all living in a loop. In that case, <em>Hitchhikers</em> will, eventually, be <em>Hitchhikers</em>, again, er, for the first time.</p>
<p>I read it to my 1- and 3-year-old a little each day or so at bedtime. As I said <a href="https://blog.joeross.me/2023/05/09/currently-reading-the.html">when I started reading this book</a>, I changed some words and skipped a few bits, but they could tell it was pretty silly, for a more a grown-up book than they’re used to.</p>
<p>Bottom line: It’s worth a read, which is a fair bit better than any of us should be saying about a lot of what’s written these days.</p>
<p>Including book reviews. 🙃</p>

<p>This is one of those things I just love about the internet, a fun, simple thing, done well. The oldest result for my name is a 1982 NY Times obituary on Joe E. Ross, another New Jersey native, of Car 54 fame.</p>

<p>Dave Rupert doesn&rsquo;t see a place in Markdown for images, and I agree. Just use an img tag. But his good point and my agreement with it aren&rsquo;t really the reason I&rsquo;m sharing a link to his post.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing it because he writes with the voice of a sage but slightly jaded manager who&rsquo;s just trying to save new developers from bad habits and messy code. It&rsquo;s refreshingly devoid of arrogance, and refreshingly full of practical examples of why his position makes sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also how I <em>try</em> to approach working with less experienced lawyers. Just replace &ldquo;developers&rdquo; with &ldquo;lawyers&rdquo; and &ldquo;code&rdquo; with &ldquo;argumentation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a> for <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Meyerweb/110431206335150934">linking</a> to Rupert&rsquo;s post on Mastodon, where I found it.</em></p>

			 <p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/05/mac-gmail-client-mimestream-reaches-1-0/">Mac Gmail client Mimestream reaches 1.0</a></p>
<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re a Gmail user, Mimestream will be a revelation. Since it was built from the ground up to understand Google’s approach to email, it doesn’t suffer from the weird workarounds required to map an IMAP protocol metaphor onto Gmail’s particular quirks. Instead, it behaves… like Gmail. But in a pure, Swift-driven Mac app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mimestream is by far the best experience a Gmail user can possibly have on a Mac. It&rsquo;s been rock solid in my daily use throughout the beta, and having those familiar keyboard shortcuts let&rsquo;s me move through email like lightning.</p>
<p>But, while betas are free, honest-to-goodness one-point-ohs have price tags, as they should:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest change in going to version 1.0 is that, after two years of using an in-progress email app for free, it’s time for Mimestream to become a real app—with real money changing hands. The app is available as a $5 monthly subscription or a $50 annual subscription. (There’s a 40% discount offer for year one available for the next few weeks.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just put down my $30, and I won&rsquo;t think twice next year to put down the full $50. Software that saves you frustration and time is worth every penny.</p>

<p>I’m reading this one with the kids at bedtime. I definitely do a bit of light word replacement here and there, mostly where death or sex are mentioned. But it’s fun, especially with the 3-year-old, who can understand just enough of it to be interested but has sufficient trouble keeping up with the weirdness to make it, eventually, conducive to falling asleep.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been poking around Bluesky and it seems like they’ve really opened up the gates over there. I’m seeing far more familiar names and avatars. And everyone seems cool, as long as you can avoid the crypto/web3 nonsense.</p>
<p>(<em>This isn&rsquo;t about Jack, or any of weird takes he&rsquo;s been dropping lately <a href="https://staging.bsky.app/profile/jack.bsky.social">at Bluesky</a>.</em>)</p>
<p>And using my domain name as my username is really, really cool.</p>
<p>But what made me want to write this is that the Bluesky team is actively involved and genuinely listening to positive and critical feedback, which is probably my favorite part of it so far. And I realize now that an active presence by the people who build it is what makes a social network appealing to me.</p>
<p>I can find a community of folks I like anywhere. Geeks are like water: we just keep spreading out until we’re everywhere. But my favorite communities in a long, long time, <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> and <a href="https:/micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, are fun and comfortable and challenging because their founders/owners/developers are constantly present.</p>
<p>They built something they love, betting that they could at least make it self-sustaining from a business standpoint because they had a sense of the kind of communities that were poorly served by pre-existing platforms.</p>
<p>for themselves because they wanted it, and then they realized other people would probably like it too, and then they realized that they could charge a really reasonable amount of money per user and build a business out of it.</p>

<p>Workflowy is easily one of my favorite #productivity apps. I’ve been using it for years for work and personal stuff and it fits my brain.</p>
<p>It’s great for work as a place to keep, for example, a list of causes of action, together with their elements and defenses. It’s also where I keep the cases I most commonly cite, with links to periodically make sure they’re still good law. Personal uses for Workflowy include everything from shopping lists to draft blog posts and to-watch/to-read lists.</p>
<p>There are many similar tools but everything else seems too bloated or complex or targeted at project managers. I don’t want to be a project manager — I just want to manage projects. Or organize. Or list. Or write.</p>
<p>Somehow, despite being a daily user, I missed the addition of optional paragraph functionality. This makes the process of going from idea to outline to draft even easier.</p>
<p>One thing you learn using Microsoft Word for most things at work is that you never, ever draft directly in Word. The same goes for using the web interface of your preferred blogging tool. These things crash. Plenty of people use Google Docs for drafting stuff, but even that seems too bloated for me these days.</p>
<p>I’m a lawyer, so there’s a level of factual detail that does eventually require me to go “offline” and finish my work in Word, to preserve confidentiality and attorney-client privilege and other ethical obligations.</p>
<p>But Workflowy has never crashed on me, in the browser or in the app itself, and having a safe starting point to develop stuff in is great.</p>

<p>but</p>

<p>That last bit is primarily, though not solely, because the 3rd Circuit had not decided such a case as this yet when the incidents in question occurred. Now that the existence of the right to record police in public is &ldquo;clearly established,&rdquo; the next time a similar case shows up in court, qualified immunity may be off the table. Hopefully that potential liability will discourage Philadelphia officers from retaliating in the future.</p>

<p>I was a law clerk when the murder of Corporal Bryon Dickson and near-murder of Trooper Alex Douglass sparked a weeks-long manhunt that resulted in the capture, trial and conviction of Eric Matthew Frein. I won&rsquo;t talk about anything I did with regard to the case (which was very little anyway), but I was living in the county seat of Milford, PA at the time and I can tell you the tragedy visibly saddened and infuriated several communities.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Such men should be sterilized. It is the State&rsquo;s right to protect women from these cowards whose masculinity is tenuous and insecure that they are too scared to attempt a real relationship in which consent for unprotected sex is freely given at some point.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Disgusting.</p>
<p>Anderson Cooper did <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a great segment on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->60 Minutes<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> about how an underfunded, understaffed and overworked New Orleans Public Defender&rsquo;s Office has started refusing felony cases. Chief PD Derwyn Bunton says he and his 52 attorneys cannot possibly represent the 20,000 clients they get annually in a way that comports with the ethical standards to which all attorneys are held, and to which criminal defendants are Constitutionally entitled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a divisive choice, but I think it&rsquo;s the right one. Public Defenders Offices are notoriously underfunded all over the country, seen as low-hanging fruit when a politician or bureaucrat needs to cut budgets. But they should be among the last budgets cut. Many criminal defendants are guilty, and many are not. Because of that, all are entitled to the same Constitutionally mandated set of rights, chief among them being the right to representation.</p>
<p>No, public defenders don&rsquo;t need and shouldn&rsquo;t get astronomical budgets. But they should not have to divide 20,000 cases between 52 lawyers, either. That&rsquo;s 384 cases per lawyer per year. Would you want to share your public defender with 383 other people? Would you feel confident that you will get your Constitutional rights to competent representation and a fair trial?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In Travis County custody case, jury will search for real Alex Jones<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Jonathan Tilove reports this story for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->American-Statesman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Kelly Jones' attorney, Bobby Newman, is engaged in some quality tactical litigation:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The first was a clip from a July 2015 broadcast in which Jones had his son, then 12, on to play the latest of some 15 or 20 videos he had made with the help of members of the Infowars team who, Jones said, had “taken him under their wing” during summer days spent at the South Austin studio between stints at tennis and Christian camps.</p>
<p>“He is undoubtedly cut out for this, and I intend for him to eclipse what I’ve done. He’s a way greater person than I was at 12,” said Jones, turning to his son. “I love you so much, and I didn’t mean to get you up here, sweetheart, and tell people how much I love you, but you’re so handsome, and you’re a good little knight who’s going to grow up, I know, to be a great fighter against the enemy.”</p>
<p>“So far this looks like good stuff,” [Alex Jones' Attorney Randall] Wilhite said. Naranjo OK’d it for viewing by the jury.</p>
<p>But Bobby Newman, the attorney for Kelly Jones guiding the court through the Infowars clips, was laying the groundwork for the argument that there is no separation between Alex Jones, father, and Alex Jones, Infowarrior.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s a solid argument, and Alex Jones is in a bit of a bind here, forced to choose between maintaining the authenticity of a lunatic his inexplicably massive fanbase worships and sacrificing that authenticity in an attempt to hang onto custody of his young children.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The magnificent stupidity of the &ldquo;nuclear option&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It’s a trainwreck. Republicans undoubtedly stole the nomination from Merrick Garland, which makes calls by the GOP for Democrats to stop being obstructionist rich in hypocrisy.</p>
<p>But then again, there’s plenty of hypocrisy in Democratic criticisms of today’s use of the “nuclear option.” After all, they made a similar move in 2013, explicitly eliminating the filibuster for all nominations except the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>It was a stupid thing for Democrats to do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in 2013<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it’s a stupid thing for Republicans to do in 2017. Why? Because these rules apply to everyone going forward, no matter which party is in power.</p>
<p>The lack of foresight and critical thinking the nuclear option displays when any party uses it are staggering, and illustrative of Congress’ toxic tendency to put pettiness and blind party loyalty before the best interests of their constituents.</p>

			 <p>I’m in a bookstore, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joseph Fox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Philadelphia, and there are people here in the cramped sometimes hallway-narrow store with me. Many of them. People I mean. Some smell like rain. That’s how close they are. It’s raining outside and they’re coming into the store and I can smell the rain on them.</p>
<p>You have to look behind you and on both sides before kneeling or unkneeling or turning one way or another. And me personally I get the sense literally everyone else in the store is there to find a specific book and they&rsquo;re all searching the stacks carefully, assiduously even. And here I am awkward and targetless and perusing aimlessly the myriad paper- and hardbacks.</p>
<p>That sweaty I-don&rsquo;t-belong-here feeling creeps in slowly at first and then a major decision crashes into my field of vision: get it the hell together and be hunted by these books with a little goddamn dignity or get out go home leave now. As many who experience similar moments can no doubt relate to, my outward demeanor doesn&rsquo;t change while this storm is raging behind my eyes. The capital v Visible me is cool as a cucumber as they say. The capital i Invisible me processes this all in a few blinks and when I open my eyes again I&rsquo;ve decided to stay.</p>
<p>These days books are most easily purchased online. However, visiting a bookstore is a special and enviable thing. When I step into a bookstore I am aware only that there is a book looking for me. I almost never have one in mind but am dogged from the moment I cross the threshold with a sense that there is one, somewhere in there, which has me in mind.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t Rilke, it never has been. I have read him, and I love him, but none of his books have ever shopped for me in a bookstore. I have often thought it was David Foster Wallace, and once even gave up early and bought The Broom of the System, lying to myself that it was the book I had been in the store to purchase. But it wasn&rsquo;t, I had just grown a bit impatient and lazy and bought it and left.</p>
<p>The covers are part of it, the titles more so, but the randomly turned-to page most of all. No other indicator is as accurate in determining which tome hunts me. If the writing doesn&rsquo;t stick in your heart like a grappling hook breaching the top of a prison wall, the book isn&rsquo;t looking for you.</p>
<p>Today it may be George Musser&rsquo;s Spooky Action at a Distance, about nonlocality in quantum mechanics. The title, the cover, and every passage I randomly turned and read all suggested a strong attraction between book and reader. Like a word on the tip of the tongue I was almost certain. But no, it isn&rsquo;t the one. I want to read it, sure, but it&rsquo;s not the one hunting me today.</p>
<p>In fact, today nothing was looking for me at all and so I leave with nothing new. Don&rsquo;t for a moment think I wasted my time though. It&rsquo;s nothing to be upset about. This visit was eventful and quietly explosive. There are sections and authors and books I must absolutely return to, whether here, physically, or online, digitally. Today was like an expedition into an unexplored region: though I return with no artifacts or specimens I have mapped whole tracts unknown to me until today.</p>
<p>Electronic books are convenient as hell, but I&rsquo;ve never ended an Amazon or iBooks shopping session feeling like I&rsquo;ve had a capital E Experience. It&rsquo;s more efficient, simpler, faster and less anxious to look for books on a computer. But it just isn&rsquo;t much fun.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If employers can self-report why can&rsquo;t employees?</p>
<p>The argument against employee reports would be:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about this: employers are already fraudulently <!-- raw HTML omitted -->minimizing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the rates. Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s okay for employees to do it, too. It isn&rsquo;t okay for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anyone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to massage the numbers in their own favor. But they do, and they will, because self-interest is a helluva drug.</p>
<p>So my thought is that having an inflated employee-reported rate to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->compare<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with minimized employer-reported rates may help regulators find the truth, somewhere between the two numbers.</p>

			 <p>A beloved relative recently included me on an email forward that I simply could not ignore. I&rsquo;m not the first person to write a rebuttal to this email. It has been making the rounds since at least 2009, as the screenshot below illustrates.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2525&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;700&rdquo;]&lt;img class=&ldquo;size-large wp-image-2525&rdquo; src=&ldquo;<a href="https://joeross1.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/27aed-scr.png?w=1024&amp;amp;h=768%22">https://joeross1.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/27aed-scr.png?w=1024&amp;amp;h=768&quot;</a> alt=&lsquo;Earliest Google result for &ldquo;An Eye Opener&rdquo; email: <a href="%5Barchive.is/jO20n%5D(https://archive.is/jO20n)'">archive.is/jO20n&rsquo;</a> width=&ldquo;700&rdquo; height=&ldquo;525&rdquo;&gt; Earliest Google result for &ldquo;An Eye Opener&rdquo; email: <a href="https://archive.is/jO20n">archive.is/jO20n</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>My response took about an hour to research and draft but there is so much factual evidence available to refute the absurd claims made in the &ldquo;An Eye Opener&rdquo; email that you could do a thesis on it. In other words, the little bit of work I did here is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the full text of the email, followed by my reply.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is the exact text of an email I received recently from a very intelligent relative:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Charity Hospital run by the Sisters of Charity in New Orleans, along with the Upjohn company developed the plasma system in the1930&rsquo;s that saved so many lives in WWII, Korea, Vietnam and in the Middle East now.</p>
<p>During the Civil War most of the nurses were nuns.</p>
<p>Even if you are not Catholic, this is eye opening:</p>
<p>When the Catholic Church was founded in the United States, there were no hospitals.</p>
<p>Today, one out of five persons in this country receive their medical care at a Catholic hospital.</p>
<p>When the Catholic Church was founded, there were no schools. Today, the Catholic Church teaches 3 million students a day, in its more than 250 Catholic Colleges and Universities, in its more than 1200 Catholic High Schools and its more than 5000 Catholic grade schools.</p>
<p>Every day, the Catholic Church feeds, clothes, shelter and educates more people than any other organization in the world.</p>
<p>The new Obama Health Mandate could end all this and the tax payers would have to make up the loss.</p>
<p>Also, all Catholic adoption services will come to an end&hellip; a human disaster.</p>
<p>There are more than 77 million Catholics in this country. It takes an estimated 50 million Catholic votes to elect a president.</p>
<p>I am asking all of you to go to the polls in 2016 and be united in replacing all Senators, Congress and the president with someone who will respect the Catholic Church, all Christians Churches of every denomination, the Jewish Synagogues and all other Religions and Temples with perhaps the exception of Islam.</p>
<p>Mr. President, you said in a speech, &ldquo;The USA is not a Christian Nation&rdquo;. You are wrong - we are a Christian Nation founded on Judeo-Christian values allowing all religions in America to worship and practice freely&hellip; something that Islam will never do.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way Mr. President, on your MUSLIM HERITAGE in America &hellip;.</p>
<p>Have you ever been to a Muslim hospital, heard a Muslim orchestra, seen a Muslim band march in a parade, know of a Muslim charity, ever seen Muslims shaking hands with a Muslim Girl Scout, or ever seen a Muslim Candy Striper volunteering in a hospital?</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a Muslim do much of anything that contributes positively to the American way of life?</p>
<p>One more note&hellip;.. in every church or synagogue, I have ever been in, in the United States, I have always seen an American flag. No mosques in the United States carriers or flies an American flag.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s circulate this to as many as possible.</p>
<p>Remember the elections are coming up in November 2016!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now, we will simply examine the facts:</p>
<p>There are no Muslim hospitals in the U.S. that I know of. However, any successful businessperson can appreciate the difficulty of running an operation which, in today&rsquo;s political climate, may only have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about 1% of the U.S. population<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as potential customers.</p>
<p>The American Blues has roots in Muslim music, probably because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about 30% of American Slaves were Muslim<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That is, until they were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->brutally enslaved<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and often forcibly converted to Christianity <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> slaveholders<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Islamic influences on Medieval Europe are also well-documented, including <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with regard to music<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (there&rsquo;s even a 13th century miniature depicting a Muslim and a Christian <!-- raw HTML omitted -->jamming on their lutes together<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>It appears Muslims influenced a great many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->other areas of European history<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which of course trickled down to U.S. history. Even Saint Thomas Aquinas <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;made a study of the Islamic writers and admitted his indebtedness to them.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>New York Public Radio affiliate WQXR has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a great story on historically significant orchestral tours<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, including the following section:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>See also: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->National Arab Orhestra<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York Arabic Orchestra<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Muslims &lsquo;Give Most To Charity&rsquo;, Ahead Of Christians, Jews And Atheists, Poll Finds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I admit, this article is three years old and relates only to British citizens, but it is data nonetheless.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Directory of 1,271 Islamic charities<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Yes, there are 4 times as many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jewish charities<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and 84 times as many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christian charities<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but the data suggest that if we don&rsquo;t know of any Muslim charities it isn&rsquo;t because they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>As for marching bands in parades, I could find none in the U.S. but I did notice that marching bands are most likely an import from Ottoman military history, as seen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Muslims do have parades, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a quick Google search<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and some careful reading will show many of the marchers are more focused on the geopolitical turmoil in their home countries rather than their religion, and many U.S. commentators, pro- as well as anti-Islam, are ignorant of that fact.</p>
<p>As for Girl Scouts, where do we begin? Here are few links:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As for volunteering:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Muslims <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> done much of anything that contributes positively to the American way of life. Like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->football<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->basketball<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->boxing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->many other things<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. While the roughly 5,900 Muslim-American military members of the U.S. Armed Forces <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make up only a bit more than a quarter of one percent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Armed Forces, their contribution to the American way of life surely cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Some Mosques do actually have American flags, like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->even ones who receive bomb threats<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If there is any doubt left as to the absurdity and ignorance of the claims made about Islam in the email this post <!-- raw HTML omitted -->destroys<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I will address them with a future article on the well-documented <!-- raw HTML omitted -->history of Christian bloodlust<!-- raw HTML omitted --> throughout the centuries. #justsayin</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The perils of marriage equality<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Professor Kimberly Mutcherson of Rutgers Law School writes at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Concurring Opinions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about Professor Katherine Franke&rsquo;s recent book <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lsquo;Wedlocked: the Perils of Marriage Equality&rsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have thought about this concern since undergrad, where postcolonial literature, feminism and even semiotics courses touched on the nature of othering as an active verb, something done to a group of people. I was lucky enough to take a course in law school called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and the Law<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Professor Leonore F. Carpenter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which expanded my understanding and interest in the dynamics of queer identity, family and legal frameworks.</p>
<p>The specific concern with which I&rsquo;ve been preoccupied since then is that there is a danger in radical acceptance or the success of various equality movements. The danger I see is in achieving a nominal or &ldquo;seat at the table&rdquo; equality that normalizes othered groups to the frameworks of the groups that have historically done the othering.</p>
<p>One infuriating example of how I think about this stuff is the so-called equality of separate-but-equal, which of course was not equality at all. In the case of race, equality is not allowing non-white people to do all the stuff white people are allowed to do, but allowing non-white people to do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->whatever it is non-white people want to do<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> what has always been allowed to white Americans.</p>
<p>I see Professors Franke and Mutcherson making a similar point about the danger of seeing marriage equality as squeezing queer couples and families into 1) heteronormative cis-gendered and/or culturally/racially segregated family models or 2) altogether new models, sometimes developed by hand-wavingly obnoxious if well-intentioned hetero-cis folks. Maybe I&rsquo;m mistaken, but the overall approach as I see it being explained by these two scholars is essentially to stop putting up new roads and signs for queer families and just get the hell out of the way.</p>
<p>Read Mutcherson&rsquo;s entire post, it&rsquo;s worth it. And I&rsquo;ve added &ldquo;Wedlocked' to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kindle wishlist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is growing faster than I can keep up.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Enough with the conspiracy theories about Justice Scalia&rsquo;s death<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I read this earlier today:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My gut tells me there is some fishing for attention going on in the head of the former D.C. police officer who said that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Was it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Liberal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> conspiracy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get President Obama one more lasting decision about the future of United States legal policy?</p>
<p>Was it a &ldquo;Conservative&rdquo; conspiracy to give Congressional Republicans and presidential candidates something &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; to Obama about<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?</p>
<p>Was it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ancient Aliens<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?</p>
<p>There was no autopsy, they say! There was a pillow above his head, they say! The President was told long before anyone else, they say (as if the President doesn&rsquo;t get most of the news before everyone else&hellip;)!</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists demand: &ldquo;What is your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->proof<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Scalia wasn&rsquo;t murdered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These stupid theories remind me of one of the frequent arguments levied against atheists: &ldquo;What is your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->proof<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that there is no god??&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->proved<!-- raw HTML omitted --> god exists in the first place?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Many articles note the ranch owner who found Scalia said there was a pillow above his head, and many conspiracy theorists point to this as suspicious. I sleep with a pillow over my head every night, and another one underneath it, using the two to drown out the sounds of an increasingly conspiratorial world so I can maintain my slumber all night long.</p>
<p>No conspiracy. Just a light sleeper.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I disagreed with much of Justice Scalia&rsquo;s Supreme Court jurisprudence but his presence on the Court was invaluable to the development of United States law and the debates from which it springs.</p>
<p>He articulated his positions in such a way that I (almost always) respected them, even when I found it hard to believe someone so intelligent was seriously asserting them. He was rarely conclusory, giving reasons for his views, and whether you agreed with those reasons or not, that&rsquo;s more than most politicians (and lawyers) usually do.</p>
<p>His death is a loss, but there are few more certain paths to some sort of immortality than thirty years on the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ndash; David Bowie, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lazarus<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>David Bowie died surrounded by family at his New York home Sunday, January 10, 2016 eighteen months after being diagnosed with cancer. He released his final album, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blackstar<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, on Friday, January 8, 2016, his birthday. I&rsquo;m listening to it as I write this article about how he inspired me.</p>
<p>Many have expressed their sorrow at our loss of Mr. Bowie on social media and it is hard to find a news story or obituary about him that is not composed at least partially of Twitter embeds. I&rsquo;m writing this because while I never met the man, his music and personality played a major role in why I started playing music and how I approach songwriting, and just plain writing, to this day. In other words, I&rsquo;m making this tragedy about me.</p>
<p>Then again, so are most other folks, I&rsquo;m just admitting it at the outset.</p>
<p>I was in high school. I had only first picked up a guitar in the last year or so and quickly befriended a couple of other guitar-toting music nerds (Hey Jonny, hey Chris). We were already big fans of the Beatles and the more recent Brit-rock band <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oasis<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And we delved into Pink Floyd and David Bowie together, finding something like our own voice in that decidedly British amalgam of rock and roll.</p>
<p>But it was Bowie who, more than all of the other musicians who inspired me in the early days of my musical development, illustrated how far the synthesis of personality and art can be taken. There&rsquo;s no need for me to explain his chameleonic permutations, they&rsquo;re as iconic as his music.</p>
<p>Throughout high school and through college &ndash; even to this day &ndash; I remained a pedestrian-looking musician, just another white guy whose long hair got shorter and dyed-black as he entered his twenties and thought he, and he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->alone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, was the saddest, most tortured soul at the party.</p>
<p>Womp womp.</p>
<p>Put simply, &ldquo;chameleonic&rdquo; is just not a word anyone would use for my appearance. But Bowie&rsquo;s music was as dynamic as his makeup tray and he seemed to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->foresee<!-- raw HTML omitted --> rather than follow fashion and sonic trends. That&rsquo;s the part of him that stuck with me, consciously, as in I&rsquo;m not just writing about it today because he has died, but as in I think about it, about him, a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t talk about writing songs very often because it&rsquo;s become sort of like a diary, a journal. Like most of what I write, songwriting for me is a would-be novelist&rsquo;s first notebook of character sketches, equal parts selfish unflattering funhouse-mirror style portrayals of myself and people I know and cringe-inducing artistic growing pains.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been writing songs since the seventh or eighth grade. They stopped sucking sometime at the beginning of college and I owe a lot of that to David Bowie. When I wrote a particularly shitty song in one style, I&rsquo;d just switch to another style. Acoustic dream-pop, rollicking early rock, simple quiet ballads, weird jazzy oddities.</p>
<p>This sort of stylistic rotation prevented me from concluding that I abso<!-- raw HTML omitted -->lutely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> should never, ever write another song in a given style. And as a result, I eventually became pretty good at writing songs in two or three of those styles.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> I also developed my own original voice, both in music and in writing, by emulating the greats and selectively shedding bits and pieces of their approach in favor of my own.</p>
<p>So now that I&rsquo;ve made it about myself, let&rsquo;s bring it back to what&rsquo;s important: there will never be another David Bowie and his loss is a cultural tragedy of a global scale, but he made one hell of a dent.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Nothing, not even death, can silence a force like David Bowie. So go <!-- raw HTML omitted -->listen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and smile.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I respect Human Resources professionals. Their job can be shitty. But so can their job descriptions. The prospects who know what you mean by &ldquo;incumbent&rdquo; are probably too pedantic and detail-oriented to apply to the likely underpaid and/or intellectually vapid position you&rsquo;re hiring for. The ones who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->don&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> know what you mean don&rsquo;t actually know what they&rsquo;re applying to, which makes them terrible prospects.</p>
<p>If machine learning can remedy that, I hope it gains wider use. But I don&rsquo;t think machine learning is necessary to stop writing the kind of drivel that passes for a job description these days. It&rsquo;s a classic failure of capitalism: when demand dramatically outstrips supply, quality decreases without consequences to the supplier. This goes for jobs, treatment by employers, and even job descriptions. They were never exactly the pinnacle of eloquence, but I&rsquo;ve seen a serious decline in the past year or so.</p>
<p>Many legal filings written by attorneys are also full of reader-hostile jargon and nonsense clearly included because the lawyer&rsquo;s writing professor said it should be included, or because the named partner at their first firm always used it. It&rsquo;s one of the most infuriating and offensive aspects of modern U.S. professional culture as far I&rsquo;m concerned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do it this way because we do it this way, because the people before us did it this way, that&rsquo;s why we do it this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ever<!-- raw HTML omitted --> say that to me. It triggers an almost instinctual, lizard-brain contempt in me and an assumption that whoever said it is incapable of critical thinking or analytical reasoning, and I can be a real asshole when I think that about someone.</p>

			 <p>Today Joshua Goldman of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CNET<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reports<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the FAA recommends requiring drone <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pilots<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to register instead of registering every single drone:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That makes perfect sense to me. I am concerned, however, about the implications for drone use when it comes to what are widely known as restraining orders, although in Pennsylvania they are called protection from abuse orders. The function of such orders is simple: make the defendant&rsquo;s physical proximity to or remote contact via telephone or third parties with the plaintiff an indirect criminal contempt. This triggers the ability to sanction and if necessary imprison a violating defendant.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, these are especially useful in domestic violence situations, custody disputes and stalking circumstances. Pennsylvania orders can last up to three years based on the judge&rsquo;s discretion, while New Jersey orders can theoretically last forever. Importantly, in both states a protection order prohibits the defendant from owning or receiving firearms. The goal is obvious: you don&rsquo;t want a nutcase kept 100 yards from his ex-wife by a protective order to have a gun with three times that range with which to attack her.</p>
<p>This is where my concern about drones comes into play. I think FAA registration of drone pilots is a great idea. However, the surveillance and yes, even remote attack capabilities of drones require the prohibition of their use by defendants in protection order matters. The FAA maintains a public-facing database of registered aircraft pilots in three categories, Airline Transport Pilot, Commercial Pilot and Private Pilot. It could add a fourth category, Drone Pilot. Then it could add registration information to its <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Web Services<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for which it provides an API with which developers can interface with the data and present it to end users.</p>
<p>This would allow authorities to cross-reference their own protection order registries, like Pennsylvania&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Protection From Abuse Database<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with the FAA registration information and remove drones when the state police remove firearms from the defendant&rsquo;s possession. Drones are an awesome technology but their value to filmmakers, scientists and geeks generally shouldn&rsquo;t blind to the fact that they can be put to nefarious uses as well.</p>

			 <p>Dan Goodin reports over at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ars Technica<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the development of technology which can use inaudible frequencies to tie together multiple unconnected devices. He <!-- raw HTML omitted -->explains<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Goodin cites a letter from the Center for Democracy and Technology to the Federal Trade Commission [<!-- raw HTML omitted -->PDF<!-- raw HTML omitted -->] describing the technical aspects of the practice and the privacy implications. I won&rsquo;t repeat what Goodin or CDT have already explained with clarity. Instead, I wanted to talk about the inability of users like us to opt out of cross-device tracking.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t the companies developing and using these tracking technologies just tell us what they&rsquo;re doing and give us the option to opt out? Obviously, requiring us to opt <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> would be the most honorable and least user-hostile approach. But I&rsquo;ll concede that as being firmly in the &ldquo;never gonna happen&rdquo; column.</p>
<p>I am open to the possibility that I set up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->straw man<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the next section of this article, so feel free to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->point it out to me<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if that&rsquo;s what you think. Just be constructive.</p>
<p>Concerns about using a straw man aside, the only logic I can see undergirding the failure to offer an opt-out mechanism is a concern that a large number of users <!-- raw HTML omitted -->would<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in fact opt out. That would obviously reduce or, in a worst-case scenario for tracking companies, eliminate the population of tracked individuals.</p>
<p>The only problem with that is that it&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bullshit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>We opt in to terms of service and privacy policy all over the web every day without reading a word of them. Projects like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ToS;DR<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TOSback<!-- raw HTML omitted --> aim to make us better informed about what we&rsquo;re agreeing to and how those agreements change over time. They are fascinating and important projects but primarily the domain of geeks like me (and, since you&rsquo;re reading this, possibly you, as well).</p>
<p>The truth is the overwhelming majority of people click &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Agree&rdquo; or &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; or whatever other button or link gets them to the web content or software they want to use. Here&rsquo;s a quote from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AdWeek<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article published in May 2015<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, citing a survey done by photography website <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ScoopShot<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s only one study, and yes, it was conducted on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SurveyMonkey<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it&rsquo;s a decent sample size. And can you honestly tell me that you or anyone else you know read the terms and policies of the sites and software you use? Probably not.</p>
<p>Is there any other reason, then, that creepy advertising tracking technology doesn&rsquo;t offer an opt-out, just like the ones we never actually make use of throughout the rest of the web? Yes, I think there is.</p>
<p>Most websites have terms of service and privacy policies, although they are usually relegated to miniscule links at the very bottom of the website&rsquo;s footer section. The European Union <!-- raw HTML omitted -->requires cookie notifications<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But when is the last time you decided not to use a website like Facebook or the BBC website because you read their policies and didn&rsquo;t consent to them? I&rsquo;ll answer for the overwhelming majority of us: never, ever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their ubiquity coupled with the dominant user response of wildly clicking &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; until you get what you came for that makes website policies such a compelling topic of discussion. The companies building the technology that uses inaudible sound to tell advertisers that your phone, computer, television and tablet all belong to the same person can minimize conversation about their products by refusing to present you with an opt-out mechanism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that desire to remain invisible and as uncontroversial as possible for as long as possible that motivates them to be so sneaky. One commenter on Goodin&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article <!-- raw HTML omitted -->puts it very well<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It sure is. The reality is that I am one of those weirdos who doesn&rsquo;t care if I&rsquo;m tracked, but I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> care when I&rsquo;m not asked to consent to it. I propose that some privacy-minded geeks more intelligent than I develop some sort of ultrasonic ad-cancelling noise generation software for us to use in our homes and offices to thwart secret ultrasonic cross-device ad tracking. You have to take that one and run with it, I&rsquo;m just an ideas man.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple has learned nothing from Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface - The Verge<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>iPad <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sales<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are indeed down, but it does not follow from that fact that iPad <!-- raw HTML omitted -->use<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is down. This <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Time<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> did the yeoman&rsquo;s work of aggregating some data about iPad sales. The bottom line is that in the five years since the iPad&rsquo;s 2010 launch, Apple has sold more than 258 million of the tablets. That&rsquo;s more iPads in the wild than people living in Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russia, Japan, Mexico, Philippines, Vietnam, Ethiopia, Egypt, Germany, Iran, Turkey, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Thailand, France, United Kingdom, or Italy (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->thanks Wolfram|Alpha<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>My dad has an Android tablet and a Windows PC. Since he got the tablet (which, interestingly from a marketing perspective, he insists on calling an iPad) he does nothing on the PC except pay bills, and that&rsquo;s primarily because most of the apps you use to pay bills on mobile devices are, to put it mildly, user-hostile antichrists of design and experience.</p>
<p>He is a sample of one, but my dad isn&rsquo;t even your typical cutting edge older gentleman. For example, he was on Aol dial-up until sometime around 2013, and refuses to use a non-clamshell mobile phone. So his taking so quickly to using a tablet implies to me that the replacement of PCs by iPads and other tablets may be closer than Tom Warren of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Verge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> thinks, although still far off.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see my dad using an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPad Pro <!-- raw HTML omitted --> though because most of his use is on the couch as a second screen. I suspect that the second screen use case coupled with the price point will dampen iPad Pro sales outside of the geek and artist demographics.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Axel Springer bans adblock users from Bild online<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>According to the report by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reuters<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->basic position on ad blocking <!-- raw HTML omitted --> is that it&rsquo;s a permissible response to shitty or intrusive advertising but whatever tool you use should have a whitelisting feature. I don&rsquo;t know what the ultimate solution to this debate will be but I know that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bild.de<!-- raw HTML omitted --> publisher Axel Springer&rsquo;s approach is unwise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to find well-done news on the internet these days that Axel Springer is only hurting itself with the new policy. Instead of focusing on taking only high-quality advertisements that aren&rsquo;t obnoxious or classless and minimizing the concomitant tracking, Bild.de is walling itself off from 30 percent of its native-language audience.</p>
<p>In short, someone at Axel Springer should be fired.</p>

<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said in a press release today:</p>

<p>The study also found that, in the consumer finance markets studied, very few consumers individually seek relief through arbitration or the federal courts, while millions of consumers are eligible for relief each year through group settlements. According to the study, more than 75 percent of consumers surveyed in the credit card market did not know whether they were subject to an arbitration clause in their contract. Fewer than 7 percent of those consumers covered by arbitration clauses realized that the clauses restricted their ability to sue in court.</p>

<p>The March 2015 CFPB report on this issue (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->PDF<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) said:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Class action lawsuits can be a pain in the ass for everyone involved and the only winners are the plaintiffs' lawyers. But the mere possibility of a class action may be enough to prevent predatory behavior on the part of service providers.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Government Is Selling Thousands of Homes to Hedge Funds Without Their Owners' Knowledge<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Jared Bennett reports at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Atlantic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>“Whatever deal that went on between Bank of America, Selene and HUD is not known to me,” he says. Uwansc maintains he has complied with the terms of his modification and has filed lawsuits against both Bank of America and Selene.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I worked at the Philadelphia Housing Authority for almost seven years. Many of the programs run by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development are poorly understood, even by the executives who are tasked with making use of them in their own cities. But many of those programs are also beneficial to the community, when properly utilized, and when the agencies involved take the time to explain the benefits to all of the stakeholders involved, from potential residents to the mayor.</p>
<p>Read the article at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Atlantic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for full context, but it sounds to me like the program tdhis article covers, the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program, or DASP, is not being sufficiently overseen and participating investors are taking advantage of &ldquo;flipping&rdquo; strategies and rental demand, especially in cities full of once-again-rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods, like Philadelphia. The demolition of high-rise public housing buildings colloquially (and, I would suggest, derogatorily) known as &ldquo;projects&rdquo; and construction of row-home style mixed-income residential developments, had decreased crime, outstanding rent, utility costs and other &ldquo;key performance metrics&rdquo; even before I left in 2013.</p>
<p>The switch in Philadelphia from high-rises to row homes reduced inventory but a simultaneous improvement in re-certification procedures, expanded homeownership counseling and planning assistance and other administrative changes dampened the negative effects of that reduction. That doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that residents should constantly be kept in the loop about the status of the mortgage for their home, especially who owns it and when the creditor to whom they owe payments has changed.</p>
<p>Consider this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(emphasis added)</p>
<p>Oaktree&rsquo;s declining to comment says perhaps far more than any comment could have said. I suspect the component of the DASP program, a core component, that allows companies like Oaktree to purchase mortgages in bulk at a discount is precisely what incentivizes foreclosing as quickly as possible and with minimal effort to remediate the default.</p>
<p>This is a worrying example of something I saw frequently while I worked at the Philadelphia Housing Authority: rarely do the interests of borrowers and residents align with those of the local, state and federal agencies tasked with providing financial and logistical assistance. In fact, the perverse reality of funding for such programs is that the more successful they are, the less likely they are to get an increase in or even flat year-over-year funding.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, beneficial to those administering the programs and running the larger organizations of which the programs are a part to achieve a balance between minimally visible progress and maximizing future funding eligibility. Yes, there are sometimes performance incentives on such programs, but they are not the norm, and it doesn&rsquo;t look like there are any here, and if there are they are not being sufficiently enforced.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take my word for it, read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jared Bennett&rsquo;s article at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Atlantic<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> in full.</p>

			 <p>Most of this article is an extensive discussion of my hunt for the best ad blocker on iOS. It isn&rsquo;t exhaustive and, given the pace at which the App Store moves, probably won&rsquo;t remain current for long. That&rsquo;s why I want to open things with my own thoughts on ad blocking, because I don&rsquo;t expect those to change any time soon.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Large publishers don&rsquo;t have much to worry about with regard to ad blocking because they have the resources to play cat-and-mouse with developers. But smaller publishers and even independent publishers of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->significant size<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, traffic-wise, are right to keep an eye on ad blocking. I don&rsquo;t think John Gruber has much to worry about either, but he also doesn&rsquo;t have time to spend staying one step ahead of blockers who blacklist his primary advertising network, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Deck<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I use blockers on desktop browsers and, now, on iOS for all the reasons so many people have already cited: ads often ruin the reading experience, trackers build creepy profiles on what we like and follow us around the web showing it to us, and sometimes the stuff a publisher publishes is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->worth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> our eyeballs, so why should we be counted among their visitors and help boost their ad rates?</p>
<p>But&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->BUT<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;</p>
<p>Can you sense that I&rsquo;m about to state a caveat to my support of the development and use of blockers? If not, you need more coffee, or to visit a doctor, or just give up reading for, like, ever.</p>
<p>Seriously though here&rsquo;s the caveat: Blockers should absolutely always and without fail include a whitelisting feature, and it is my personal opinion that to use blockers without actively using the whitelisting feature is entitled, unethical and hypocritical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s entitled because it assumes you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->deserve<!-- raw HTML omitted --> everything published on the web for free, just because, like, you&rsquo;re <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unethical because there are absolutely jobs to which blocking poses an existential threat, and jobs are people, and people have families, and feelings, and futures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hypocritical because, at least in my mind, the primary purpose of using blocking tools is to say to publishers and their ad partners, unequivocally, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you&rsquo;re doing it wrong<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But to say that sincerely you have to have in mind that there is a way of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->doing it right<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And, of course, there is: unobtrusive, minimally tracking advertisements carefully monitored and held to a far higher standard than that to which most are held these days.</p>
<p>It sends no signal to simply block everything indiscriminately, which is what you&rsquo;re doing if you don&rsquo;t use a whitelist. I want publishers who display ads respectful of their readers to continue to be able to sell that inventory. I want to see a virtuous cycle: I want them to be able to charge more for that space because they&rsquo;re on whitelists their less respectful competitors aren&rsquo;t on.</p>
<p>So I use ad blockers on desktop and mobile, and also spend a lot of time on building whitelists full of sites whose ads I don&rsquo;t mind and whose business model I want to help preserve for at least as long as it takes for them to find and transition to whatever model comes next.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Apple released iOS 9 earlier this month and Safari, the built-in browser, gained the ability in 64-bit devices to load what Apple calls (a bit disingenuously&hellip;) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;content blockers&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. These are apps you install and enable in Settings &gt; Safari &gt; Content Blockers. This new class of apps is almost exclusively used for blocking display advertisements and tracking scripts that follow you around the web building an anonymized-but-still-targeted-at-your-face profile about you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this to express my opinion, because that&rsquo;s what the internet is for. I&rsquo;ll explain my reasons and then recommend steps you should or shouldn&rsquo;t take based on how much you agree with me.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_1388&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;576&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Settings screen from Peace, an iOS ad blocker by Marco Arment[/caption]</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use a case study to illustrate the acceleration of the debate about ad blockers on iOS and desktop web browsers. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Marco Arment<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an early <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tumblr<!-- raw HTML omitted --> employee, the creator of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instapaper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (which he later sold) and, more recently, of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> podcast service for iOS, released his own ad blocker, called Peace, on September 16, 2015, announcing it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in a blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. He explained in that article:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was one of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->many<!-- raw HTML omitted --> purchasers who paid $2.99 to try out Peace on my iPhone, helping to send it flying to the top of the paid app charts almost immediately. It&rsquo;s well-designed and includes the ability to do one-time exceptions or permanently whitelist specific sites (more on that later). Arment had to explain in a post the day after Peace launched <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why Peace blocks the classy ad network The Deck<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This explanation was important because Arment displays advertisements on his own site using The Deck. It was a clear example of the cognitive dissonance the ad blocking issue causes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The day after <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, though, Arment did something surprising: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he pulled Peace from the App Store<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and explained how everyone could get a refund. That&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tens of thousands of dollars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to which he said &ldquo;Nevermind&rdquo; because he developed a crisis of conscience. He said:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Arment can afford to take the hit, financially, but what&rsquo;s more surprising about this move is that he is a world-class iOS developer, constantly improving and maintaining a popular podcast app, who spent a lot of time and effort and stress building an app that, only days after it launched, he decided to kill. And Apple took notice: the company notified him on September 21 it would be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;proactively refunding&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> every purchase of his ad blocker.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect that because Apple included in iOS 9 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->its very own News app<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which doesn&rsquo;t allow content blocking and thus is now the only bullet-proof way for publishers to ensure their advertisements come along for the ride when someone reads their stuff. I wonder if it was more a kind gesture to Arment, whose great apps bring a lot of attention and a nontrivial amount of money to Apple (who gets 30 percent off the top for every purchase of every paid app) and iOS.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I tried five different ad blockers<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, listed below:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I quickly realized my dealbreaker feature while evaluating those apps: whitelisting. That immediately eliminated AdMop and Crystal.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The next one I eliminated was Blockr which, while it does offer a whitelist, is a little too complex for my tastes, requiring you to choose from several different elements to whitelist on each site. I prefer simplicity just from an aesthetic perspective, but more importantly &ldquo;normals&rdquo; &ndash; non-geeks &ndash; are less likely to use a feature that looks complex and bloated, not because they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get it&rdquo; but because they&rsquo;re not obsessed with spending hours tweaking the settings on their gadgets.</p>
<p>Peace is my favorite because not only does it offer a whitelist, but the action extension you use to whitelist a site includes all of Peace&rsquo;s other settings, including a global disable button. Even more interesting is the separate action extension Arment included to &ldquo;Open in Peace,&rdquo; meaning you can disable the app globally and selectively load overburdened pages in Peace on demand. While I&rsquo;ll focus on building a whitelist, the inclusion of a selective-enable option demonstrates the amount of thought Arment put into this issue. This wasn&rsquo;t just a money grab, it was an experiment. That&rsquo;s what the Scott Meyer, CEO of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ghostery<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the company whose blocking database Arment licensed, called it, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Peace App Experiment<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. His thoughts echoed Arment&rsquo;s:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I suspect based on that language and Arment&rsquo;s own post about withdrawing the app that future improvement by Apple to its blocking framework may enable the nuance to which Peace aspired. For now though, the app isn&rsquo;t available anymore and, while if you already have it installed and don&rsquo;t delete it, you can keep using it, there&rsquo;s no guarantee of any support or updates. I plan to hang onto it and will probably stick with it until Purify somehow differentiates itself.</p>

<p>But for those of you who haven&rsquo;t yet tried one out, or are still on the fence about which one to use, and haven&rsquo;t yet purchased and installed Peace, or have deleted it since it was pulled from the App Store, I have to recommend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Purify<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Yes, it&rsquo;s $3.99, no, that shouldn&rsquo;t stop you from getting it. It has a dead-simple and fast whitelisting option and lets you decide to block images, scripts and fonts as well, although only ads and trackers are blocked by default.</p>

<p>Purify also has the benefit of being developed by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chris Aljoudi<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, maker of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->uBlock extension<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for desktop browsers. uBlock also has a dead-simple whitelisting option. Aljoudi developed uBlock <!-- raw HTML omitted -->out in the open<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it&rsquo;s free, so you can get a good sense of the quality of his work before buying Purify, if my recommendation isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>iOS 9 marks the first time Apple has included content blocking in the mobile operating system, and it almost certainly is part of a larger strategy to squeeze other large companies reliant on advertising models for revenue. But its bound to put pressure on small and medium publishers to clean up their advertising standards or consider alternatives like membership programs or tip jars, used by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brett Terpstra<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Loop<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Katie Floyd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and many others, with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;ll keep on blocking the crap and whitelisting the good guys. How about you?</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Missouri Teenagers Protest a Transgender Student’s Use of the Girls’ Bathroom<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t blame the students for protesting. Kids can be cruel, and kind of dumb. I certainly was.</p>
<p>But parents and attorneys like Derrick Good display a shameful vacuity in couching their bigotry in terms like &ldquo;physical privacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karen Workman quotes one such parent:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Requiring the teen in question, Lila Perry, to use the men&rsquo;s room is no different than requiring Mr. Good&rsquo;s daughters to use the men&rsquo;s room. The absurdity of Good&rsquo;s position is that it presumes Lila is a male <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pretending<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that she is a female so she can infiltrate Mr. Good&rsquo;s daughters' physical privacy in the ladies' room.</p>
<p>And the twisted aspect of this circumstance is that Good&rsquo;s &ldquo;fight&rdquo; for that privacy has obliterated Lila&rsquo;s own physical privacy by turning her gender dysmorphia, with which she appears to have otherwise been coping rather well, into a national news story and an indictment of her morals.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time the Christian advocacy group with which Good worked have used the plight of a child to their benefit. The hilariously named &ldquo;Alliance Defending Freedom&rdquo; compared &ldquo;threats to its freedom,&rdquo; which, hilariously, it claims are &ldquo;multiplying,&rdquo; to the death of a small boy on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->its Who We Are page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not impossible though for such people to change their minds. Consider the father of D.W. Trantham, speaking in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a story about parents pulling a child out of D.W.&rsquo;s school<!-- raw HTML omitted --> after the school allowed her to choose which bathroom she would use:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Tim admits he used to be the same way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was some of those people myself at one point in my life,&rdquo; Tim said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand what transgender was or the issues involved.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ms. Perry is not discouraged:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Years of data suggest that between 30 percent and 50 percent of transgender people attempt suicide at least once.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> There is a mountain of data since then, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Wikipedia article on suicide among LGBT youth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a good starting point if you&rsquo;re interested in further research.</p>
<p>My point it that as a former Catholic of about 18 years I&rsquo;m certain it&rsquo;s rather <!-- raw HTML omitted -->un<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christian to consciously exacerbate what is already a difficult process for transgender youth.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s inappropriate to use these tragic murders as fodder for the never-ending Second Amendment debate, and people on both sides of the isle are already guilty of that.</p>
<p>If the killer&rsquo;s intent was to terrorize, are those people who are disseminating photographic and video imagery of the murders aiding and abetting that son of a bitch, even after his suicide?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obviously emotional over this thing, as many people are, and the aiding and abetting thing is more a thought experiment than a serious question. But if we don&rsquo;t at least think about it, try to push the debate forward somehow, if nothing changes at all, Alison and Adam died for nothing. That&rsquo;s unacceptable.</p>

This guy has a wife and kids, who not only haven&rsquo;t lived with him for 34 years, but who have had to deny he assaulted and murdered a teenager, as well.

<p>But there is no utility in blaming or blessing any single person: what changes can we make to the criminal justice system that will prevent mistakes like this from happening in the first place?</p>
<p>Maybe life with parole shouldn&rsquo;t be on the table unless there is conclusive DNA evidence of the defendant&rsquo;s guilt. I don&rsquo;t know. But we can&rsquo;t shrug our shoulders about it. After all, we were happy to incarcerate Fogle for the rest of his life when we thought he took someone else&rsquo;s life. What will do now that we have effectively taken most of his?</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I vascillate between <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ghostery<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->uBlock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but they do the same thing: disable the scripts that power advertisements and tracking on the web.

<p>But Arment is right. There&rsquo;s no nice way to say it: publishers with shitty ads won&rsquo;t remain viable much longer in the face of increased user awareness and response.

<p>If the court hearing this case on August 11th upholds the FTC&rsquo;s decision to exercise its import ban authority in the digital realm the ramifications will be far-reaching and almost immediate.

<p>This is an inappropriate use of drones, wholly lacking in basic decency. It&rsquo;s not impossible, or even implausible, that a drone-related delay will some day result in the destruction of one or more homes or even get someone burned to death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not far removed from scumbaggery like the Ohio jackass who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->filmed the aftermath of a fatal car accident<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instead of helping the victims.

<p>Connecticut lawyer and commercial drone lobbyist Peter Sachs created the Drone Pilots Association to advocate for more commercial drone use. There is even video <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on his website<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of his using a drone to assist the volunteer fire department he works with.</p>
<p>The difference between sachs and the California morons is that Sachs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->offered<!-- raw HTML omitted --> his drone to the department <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for its use<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in battling a blaze. So it&rsquo;s clear that drones can be a useful tool in fighting fires, they just shouldn&rsquo;t be used for fire tourism when firefighters, homes and civilians are potentially in danger.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Antitrust official inappropriately lauds Amazon&rsquo;s &ldquo;disruptive business model&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>DOJ antitrust head William J. Baer, speaking at a London antitrust conference:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That is an inappropriate way for a federal antitrust official to speak about a major market participant. Amazon did not make noise about Apple&rsquo;s ebooks collusion for the good of its customers. They did it because low prices keep them on top, and because no other company is willing to bear the losses Amazon can endure, there is no end to their dominance in sight.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s attempt to raise prices in cooperation with five publishers <!-- raw HTML omitted -->did not end well for the Cupertino company<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and rightly so, but their motivations were logical. Amazon maintains low prices and therefore the illusion that they are doing customers a favor, and in the long run doing authors and publishers a favor by expanding the pool of would-be customers who can afford ebooks.</p>
<p>However, there is at least <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some<!-- raw HTML omitted --> truth to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->concerns authors and publishers have expressed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about Amazon&rsquo;s dominance. The company is in a position to decide what books a large majority of book buyers can access. It&rsquo;s a wise short-term strategy both business-wise and legally because it is as quiet and passive as Apple&rsquo;s conspiracy was bold and aggressive. But long-term it&rsquo;s likely to expose the company to regulatory inquiry at a time when Amazon is contemplating things like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->drone delivery<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which will likely face stiffer regulation sooner than later, especially when put to retail use.</p>
<p>Of course based on Assistant Attorney General Baer&rsquo;s comments at the Chatham House Annual Antitrust Conference, Amazon has at least one friend in a position, and a mindset, to lionize them despite questionable competition strategies.</p>

<p>I have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->written about this before<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it&rsquo;s worth reminding you. These days many companies offer an official privacy policy and an easier-to-read but not so official abridged version. Sometimes the two do not agree:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One page, in colloquial English, says that the company values trust: “It’s why we work hard to protect your data. And why your info is not for sale. To anyone.”</p>
<p>Another page, containing Nest’s official privacy policy, however, says: “Upon the sale or transfer of the company and/or all or part of its assets, your personal information may be among the items sold or transferred.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I know privacy policies are long and boring, but it&rsquo;s worth at least scanning them to get a sense of what will happen to the information the company collects about you if they ever sell or go under. You may not like what you find.</p>

			 <p>This week I devote the entire newsletter to the Supreme Court decision declaring bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. I try to provide a variety of viewpoints despite the fact that I agree with the general assertion that the Constitution does not permit bans on the marriage of two consenting unrelated adults.</p>
<p>I also thought it prudent to include in this week&rsquo;s introduction my own in-depth legal analysis of the ruling, which I have worked on for years in anticipation of today&rsquo;s decision and present now in its voluminous and intellectually unassailable entirety:</p>

<p>So [ THIS SPACE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK ].</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I always thought that very uncertainty was far worse than moral opposition to same-sex marriage. Moral opposition can be understood in terms of how someone was raised, how passively or actively they embrace confirmation bias or (more common than the other two among politicians, I suspect) the need to appeal to a particular constituency.</p>
<p>But the uncertainty of interstate differences in marriage law has a profound <!-- raw HTML omitted -->practical<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and detrimental) effect on myriad decisions same-sex couples have to make all the time about issues like travel, employment and estate planning.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Chief Justice Roberts' dissent suggests that he may have considered things differently if he were in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->legislator&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> shoes but thinks it inappropriate for the Court to decide the issue.

It is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->possible<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->morally<!-- raw HTML omitted --> support a right to same-sex marriage <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but also<!-- raw HTML omitted --> take the position that the Supreme Court is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the appropriate venue for governmental affirmation of that right.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once again, it&rsquo;s hard to see this as anything but hypocrisy from the letter-writers. After all, he didn&rsquo;t merely disclose classified information, he did it in the context of moral turpitude (providing it to his then-mistress/biographer), and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->then<!-- raw HTML omitted --> he lied about it.</p>
<p>Speaking of context, here&rsquo;s a bit more about someone who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only<!-- raw HTML omitted --> disclosed classified information, with no moral turpitude or subsequent lying:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Perhaps some people will agree Petraeus, a retired four-star general, should get more latitude than mere officers and analysts would get. But he was the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->head<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the CIA at the time of his offense, and should have been a shining example of perfect adherence to national security classification regulations. Isn&rsquo;t it possible that the head of the CIA had information even more sensitive than the anti-nuclear Iran operation disclosed by Sterling?</p>
<p>Of course it is possible, and likely. So it&rsquo;s hard to see justice in an outcome that results in zero jail time for Petraeus.</p>

<p>This is fascinating to me because the documents obtained by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> describe the purpose of the partnership as to “jointly explore if cell towers and communications could possibly support Unmannned Aerial Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) for communications and surveillance of UAS <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at low altitudes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” (emphasis added).</p>
<p>NASA typically focuses on altitudes so high they&rsquo;re, well, in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->space<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so why are they involved with developing low-altitutde drone tracking technology?</p>
<p>I want to note that I&rsquo;m not necessarily opposed to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->someone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the government being able to keep track of all the drones that will inevitably be zipping around.

<p>It is not an absurd ruling, although I certainly take issue with the claim that, as the MPAA alleged, Popcorn Time &ldquo;has no legitimate purpose and it only serves to infringe copyright.&rdquo; There are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plenty<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->places<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->find<!-- raw HTML omitted --> legal <!-- raw HTML omitted -->torrents<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I know most people are using Popcorn Time for piracy though, because they ask me if it is illegal, since it &ldquo;seems a lot like Netflix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->definitely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> illegal to use Popcorn Time or any other software to download, disseminate, view or otherwise consume any movie, song or other media for which you would otherwise have to pay money.</p>
<p>This is the insightful bit of the article, though:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here is an interactive version of the graph displayed above, showing worldwide search volume from the preceding twelve months:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;q=netflix,+HBO,+Popcorn+Time&amp;date=today+12-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz&amp;tz&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=700&amp;h=400<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Netflix is doing just fine, for now. But HBO, excepting a bump in mid-April coinciding with the increased promotion of their new HBO Now service, is losing ground to Popcorn Time in worldwide search.</p>
<p>Here is the same type of search volume comparison, but this time zoomed in to the preceding 90 days and including only HBO and Popcorn Time:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;q=HBO,+Popcorn+Time&amp;date=today+3-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz&amp;tz&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=700&amp;h=400<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>HBO does not have as wide a lead as Netflix, but the time to react to stiff competition is not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->after<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that compeitition has matched or overtaken you. For Netflix and HBO, that time is right now. Netflix has massive infrastructure and an increasingly impressive library of original productions. And HBO has NBO Now, uh, now, which unbundles the premium channel from cable subscriptions. These are both good reactions to the rise of competitors, legitimate and otherwise. But those strategies are not enough.</p>
<p>The takeaway? Popcorn Time has become similar to Anonymous or, albeit a more controversial comparison, Al Qaeda. That is, it is not a single organization answering to a traditional leadership hierarchy. It is a splintered collection of rogue outfits, some more law-respecting than others, none &ldquo;in charge.&rdquo; It may represent the next step in business strategy companies like Netflix and HBO will need to take to continue their success.</p>
<p>The person or company that comes up with a way to legally and technically monetize torrent consumption of popular media at scale will be the next Mark Zuckerberg or Google.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go think about how to legally and technically monetize torrent consumption of popular media at scale.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is interesting. Tesla, to me, has made Google look a little old school, in a bad way. What&rsquo;s more disruptive? Waiting until you&rsquo;ve perfected automobile automation everywhere, or enable what you&rsquo;re confident you&rsquo;ve done well?</p>
<p>Of course, a base Model S goes for $63,570 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->after<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the federal tax credit. So I won&rsquo;t be automated-ly driving around any freeways for at least a decade (student loan reform, anyone?). But the fact that Tesla can enable automated driving with nothing more than a software update speaks volumes to where the industry is headed.</p>

<p>An anonymous author writes at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vice.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Her first attempt went through to voicemail. Quietly and tearfully, all she could say was &ldquo;help me&rdquo; a dozen or so times. I wondered if he was at work. It could have been hours before he was able to check his phone. In our last stroke of good fortune for the night, he called back a few seconds later. I can&rsquo;t remember exactly what was said or how long they talked for; it might have been a minute, it might have been five. She mentioned that there was a man here she didn&rsquo;t know who was claiming to be her boyfriend, and in a sort of exaggerated stage whisper I said, &ldquo;George! It&rsquo;s me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened for a little while longer and then passed the phone to me. &ldquo;He wants to talk to you.&rdquo; I spoke to George for a couple of minutes. I&rsquo;ve never been so relieved to hear the voice of a girlfriend&rsquo;s ex. He calmly talked me through the next steps – to get her into her flat, sit her down and pull up something she&rsquo;d seen before on Netflix. Familiarity was key, he told me. I thanked him and returned the phone. They talked for a few more seconds, then she hung up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George says I can trust you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael Riley and Jordan Robertson, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reporting a fascinating story<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bloomberg<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The act exempts intelligence and law-enforcement activities, allowing the government to respond more aggressively than private-sector firms. There’s little indication, though, that military and intelligence agencies have used their most powerful tools to shut down attacks on businesses, as the U.S. has attempted to address foreign-based hacking through diplomacy and the courts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Diplomacy and the courts are clearly inadequate channels for preventing, halting or discouraging foreign-based hacking.</p>
<p>The question, then, is whether the U.S. government will use its broader “revenge” authority under the CFA to defend not only itself but private U.S. companies. This method would be problematic from a funding perspective, and may cause diplomatic friction.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the CFA could be amended to allow “proportional responses” by private U.S. companies to foreign-based hacking. This method would be problematic from oversight and transparency perspectives, subjecting revenge hacking to market dynamics and the “black box” in which companies conduct so much of their business (especially when they’re privately held).</p>
<p>Yes, companies often have to deal with reporting requirements in the aftermath of a major data breach, but they don’t have to disclose any countermeasures under any current state or federal notification regime I can find.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best solution would involve some hybrid of these. For example, a department of government investigators and hackers could be assigned in small groups to companies facing imminent or ongoing foreign-based hacking.</p>
<p>They could embed into the companies like journalists sometimes embed into military units, assisting the company in its response and pulling the trigger on revenge hacks, insulating the company from CFA immunity.</p>
<p>The hybrid method minimizes government expense, maximizes company involvement and allows for the use of transparency laws such as the Freedom of Information Act by journalists and policy analysts to peek inside the black box.</p>
<p>I’m obviously not going to come up with a perfect solution in a short blog post, but it’s worth thinking about.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Several excellent writing professors have told me throughout my life that you start by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->starting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Introductions, caveats and excuses delay your goal and bore or confuse the reader. Don’t tell people what you’re going to do. Do it.</p>
<p>But they also advised me always to write with my audience in mind. This is a blog, and you’re still reading, which suggests you like to read blogs, or at least my blog. So I’m assuming you’re prepared for and maybe even expecting some opinions. Here they are, by way, as they say, of introduction.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I can be a cynical, pessimistic bastard.</p>
<p>I can’t help it, and I really don’t want to help it. The world is a nasty, ugly place where terrible things happen to innocent people all the time. I’m convinced, through arrogance or narcissism or rationalization, that my gloomy outlook keeps me well-prepared for those dismal days we all inevitably encounter, and insulates me from the worst disappointments. Optimism sounds in my ears like a synonym for naivety.</p>
<p>Told you: I’m a bastard. But today I’m going to break character for a few hundred words.</p>
<p>I don’t often write about my work. I never have. I think it’s a good rule to stay away from what you’re currently doing, especially in the world of the law, where much of it is privileged and confidential.</p>
<p>It’s unprofessional to complain about your job in any detail, and as a cynical, pessimistic bastard I find joyous reports about one’s work untrustworthy at best. I have stories from previous jobs that would make your eyeballs burst from your face. But even if I was unscrupulous about what I was willing to share, to the extent that I wrote here about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everything<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, what stories would I have left to tell at parties?</p>
<p>So there it is. That’s the introduction my writing advisors always advised against. But I think I did okay. I needed all that to make it clear to you why the rest of this little essay is an exception for me.</p>
<p>I don’t have to violate any privilege or confidentiality to say a typical Common Pleas court sees a lot of depressing stuff: divorce, custody, drug addiction, acrimonious estate distributions, and worse. Yes, our judges also perform marriages, but those aren’t really cases, so the law clerks never have occasion to attend.</p>
<p>From where I am sitting, it is often a court of dismantling, of endings.</p>
<p>Today, though, I was present for the first time at an adoption proceeding. It was emotional for the family. And all of the Court’s personnel were doing something we rarely do during court proceedings: we were smiling.</p>
<p>While I think family is most clearly defined by something ineffable in our hearts, legal recognition gives that definition life in the outside world.</p>
<p>And that can be just as important, especially when it comes to the right to protect, provide benefits to or make healthcare decisions for your family when they are unable to do those things for themselves.</p>
<p>It’s hard to be a cynical, pessimistic bastard while you watch a group of children and adults get their first photograph taken as a legally recognized family. Today, even if only for thirty minutes, ours was a court not of dismantling, but a court of building, and beginnings.</p>
<p>What a beautiful thing.</p>

			 <p>This is another post that began as a mere link post and became, by the time I was done writing it, an article in its own right. When I’m doing more than brief commentary, an article of my own feels more appropriate. There’s more room for opinion in a full article, and I like few things more than expressing my opinions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was heartened to read that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Plus will allow custom gender self-identification<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Googler Rachael Bennett announced the new gender options, appropriately enough, on her Google Plus page, saying:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This may not seem important to cisgendered<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> readers, just as naming a state anti-discrimination law <!-- raw HTML omitted -->after Apple CEO Tim Cook<!-- raw HTML omitted --> may not seem like a big win for the LGBTQ community at large.</p>
<p>Google’s recent move, though, exceeds even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Facebook’s more than 70 custom gender options<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Many of us use our social networking profiles as an important or even primary way of presenting ourselves to the world. It’s therefore important that we can be as vague or as specific as we want to be on those social networks, so we maintain control over our own identities.</p>
<p>But people who are comfortable with their gender or sexual orientation “in real life” may, in the online world, suffer the reverse of being “outed.” Namely, that while they live “out” in real life, limited options for expressing their gender or sexual orientation might force them to misrepresent themselves online.</p>
<p>And people who aren’t yet “out” in real life may see a lack of options for accurate self-expression as yet another point of social pressure on them to delay coming out. The two problems, though opposites, are equally disturbing. Such circumstances can be degrading and depersonalizing, and Google’s change to gender options is a small but important step toward solving those and similar problems.</p>
<p>Sexual orientation and gender identity are too often viewed, especially by cis people, as binary, non-fluid characteristics. The truth, as I understand it<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is that sexual orientation and gender identity are often composed of an interplay of continuums. More than that, for many people the two are not fixed points, but fluid and shifting throughout life, especially young life. That makes the proliferation of custom self-identification options on social networks a great thing.</p>
<p>The law, of course, has a very long way to go in this area, but that’s a matter for another article altogether.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve heard from many people who insist their iPhone or iPad “can’t handle” or “doesn’t fit” iOS 8. I read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about a slow-down in updates to iOS 8. John Gruber of Daring Fireball <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first posited<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that some well-documented software bugs were making people reluctant to update.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->follow-up post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reminded me how many times I’ve been asked by “normals” how I managed to update my iPhone 5. Their phones, the common story goes, just don’t have enough free space available to perform the update.</p>
<p>I know this is frustrating, so I wanted to share some quick and easy advice on the topic. First, if your iOS device is low on space, it’s probably because of all those photos and videos you’re taking. Learn <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how to move that stuff to your computer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so you can safely delete it from your device.</p>
<p>Second, if you have an iPhone 4 or 4s, think hard before updating to iOS 8. Some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reports<!-- raw HTML omitted --> suggest you’ll have a much slower device after the update. There are some neat new features, but none of them are worth slowing your phone down.</p>
<p>Third, make sure your iPhone or iPad is fully charged before you try to update. While it will be plugged into the computer and therefore charging during the update, it’s best to be safe about these things. Make sure your battery icon is green before you start the update and you should be fine.</p>

			 <p>My iPhone 5 recently stopped charging, unless I propped the phone upside down against an inclined surface like a lamp stand or a keyboard. I’m not in a position to buy one of those fancy new iPhones, so I shopped around in the internet’s DIY isle.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I found a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->well-reviewed set of iPhone surgery tools<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and even a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->well-reviewed replacement part<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Amazon. Armed with those and an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->instructional YouTube video<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I planned to replace the part myself.</p>
<p>Luckily, one of my many neuroses involves exhaustively reading through reviews before I buy anything from Amazon. It’s my favorite part of the site. I don’t even consider products with less than 25 or so reviews.</p>
<p>In a bricks-and-mortar store, you probably only have the staff to ask for advice, and they’re obviously biased. And if you’re anything like me, you probably know far more about the product than they do. Always take advantage of the availability of reviews on Amazon.</p>
<p>Anyway, with the necessary tools in my cart and the video queued up in the Watch Later section of my YouTube account, I headed over to read some reviews. That’s when I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this gem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Amazon user DullJack, who wrote:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But I had looked in there and I didn’t see anything, DullJack. So what gives? He continues:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ah. I shined a light into it and alas, there it was. I turned my phone off (better safe than sorry when poking around inside your iPhone with anything sharp or metal) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gently<!-- raw HTML omitted --> used a paper clip to pull out more lint that I would have though could fit in there. Do this over a piece of white paper to get the full effect.</p>
<p>So. Much. Lint.</p>
<p>Then, I plugged it in with the reckless abandon I had used before the problems began. A small white Apple logo appeared in the middle of the screen. The phone booted up and the battery icon showed it was charging. I moved it around in all the common ways that had been causing it to stop charging.</p>
<p>Fixed!</p>
<p>I don’t use exclamation points very often on this site because that’s just not the tone I’m going for over here. But that one was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->obligatory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The sense of relief I felt upon learning I wouldn’t need to expose my iPhone’s innards to the harsh light of day is something only fellow geeks can understand.</p>
<p>Of course, exposing an iPhone’s innards to the harsh light of day is something only fellow geeks would even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->consider<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, too.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson, well, several lessons, to you all:</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Economist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote in 2011<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the end of the legal industry’s lofty heights, saying of one large but ill-fated American firm:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Legal services continue to unbundle as traditionally firm-based work like document review is outsourced and electronic discovery becomes more complex. Chicago-based law firm Winston and Strawn is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bucking both trends<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, performing e-discovery for not only itself but other firms and forgoing staffing agencies to directly hire and provide benefits to its document review attorneys.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The firm’s e-discovery division brings in little revenue compared to the firm’s other practice areas. But it has seen three years of growth amid increasing demand for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a la carte<!-- raw HTML omitted --> e-discovery services from other law firms and non-clients. This is a classic example of a business disrupting itself before outsiders irreparably damage it. Ben Thompson wrote an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->exhaustive case study<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of Apple’s own self-disruption that perfectly illustrates the strategy.</p>
<p>Many firms are still trying to cope with the boom in third-party legal services providers and complaints about the cost of good legal representation. Formerly bullet-proof business models no longer guarantee the luxurious profits to which so many law firms were once accustomed. And law firm leadership, like publishing and music executives before them, must find innovative ways to provide new value to clients and industry peers.</p>
<p>That’s why law firms like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Winston and Strawn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are doing more ancillary legal work in-house. I wonder whether more firms will pitch those services to their competitors. It sounds counterintuitive to provide valuable services to competitors, but I think there’s a case to be made for it as a way to revitalize the legal industry.</p>
<p>Many law firms could use guidance on business process improvement, e-discovery, technology, management consulting and more. No one is more qualified to provide those service to law firms than other law firms. Two factors should minimize the fear of deliberate sabotage by a firm you have hired in a non-legal consulting role. The first is a reputational consideration and the second is an ethical one.</p>
<p>Law firms providing their own third-party services to clients and non-clients, including other law firms, have the opportunity every business has when it is among the first to market with an innovative high-value product or service. That opportunity is the chance to become the gold standard, to set the bar high and be the first name that comes up when someone seeks out that product or service. It makes good business sense to treat that first-mover reputational advantage as you would any valuable asset, with great care and cultivation.</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<p>p&gt;Law firms, via the attorneys who helm and staff them, are subject to myriad ethical requirements. The same processes currently in place at most large law firms to manage conflicts of interest, particularly with regard to walling off potentially conflicted attorneys from a given client or matter, could be easily applied to the firms consulting clients. In fact, the team within a firm which provides third-party consulting services to other firms could be completely walled off from the firms legal work, insulating the consulting services from concerns about endangering relationships with and the interests of current, former and prospective clients.</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>HuffPo and BuzzFeed co-founder Jonah Peretti recently said in a long and fascinating <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interview<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Felix Salmon published at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This reminded me of an idea I’ve been kicking around for a while about how best to approach digital editorial strategy: it requires an ability to wield metrics, vision and instinct in just the right proportions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It’s something I’ve been a part of for my own tiny blog here, an arts and culture <!-- raw HTML omitted -->website<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I co-founded, and even a business journal’s web presence. I’ve learned a few important things from my experience with editorial strategy, and while none of them are particularly surprising or mysterious, I think writing them out will be helpful to myself and perhaps to others.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Metrics are a great place to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->begin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a conversation about editorial strategy but a terrible way to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->end<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it. I’ve seen metrics substituted for thinking critically about editorial direction all over the web, and what’s worse is I’ve been in the room when some of those poor decisions were made and I failed to object. It’s not a mistake I’m proud of, nor one I would make again.</p>
<p>But it’s easy to criticize after the fact. True leadership demands urgency. Whenever metrics are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> deciding factor in an editorial decision, someone is making a mistake and it’s your responsibility to tell them.</p>
<p>Be respectful when their name is closer to the top of the org-chart than yours, but be direct and back up your assertions with evidence. Even if you’re outranked by everyone else in the room, at worst, you’ll be ignored, and at best you’ll show initiative and concern for the publication’s success.</p>
<p>I’m not saying there is no place for metrics in editorial strategy. They should absolutely be involved in the decision-making process, but they should never be the sole ingredient. In other words, these days metrics are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->usually<!-- raw HTML omitted --> necessary<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->never<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sufficient to make an informed editorial judgement.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Pure reactivity is the wrong way to use metrics, and looks something like this:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Everyone clicks this type of story, so let’s do more of this type of story!&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Don’t use metrics to narrowly define editorial strategy. After all, an algorithm could do that with little or no human intervention (and, as I’ll discuss below, they often do). Popular topics don’t need much additional promotion. They surface organically and allow you to focus on promoting lesser-known work of equal quality. This is a powerful concept if you’re wiling to use it in your strategy sessions.</p>
<p>Use metrics as one factor in your strategy. After all, the numbers are way to read between your own lines and to learn what drives popular content beyond mere keywords. That looks something like this:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Everyone clicks on this type of story. What about it, beyond the mere subject matter, makes it so appealing?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are many reasons some content does more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pageviews<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, higher <!-- raw HTML omitted -->time-on-page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or lower <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bounce rates<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than other content. Here are some illustrations of the problem of a narrow band of popular topics getting the majority of attention, and some ways I have thought up and in some cases successfully implemented to solve the problem.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Eli Pariser popularized the idea of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->filter bubble<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an explanation for how tailored web content reinforces viewpoints with which we already agree, and insulates us from alternative perspectives. Metrics are often used to do this on websites.</p>
<p>The most-read stories of the previous day might be featured prominently in the sidebar. This additional exposure gets them even more clicks, and even if the software causes articles older than one day to “age out” of the featured-posts box, it still severely limits the potential for featuring other articles.</p>
<p>This may be the problem at some sites: your digital publication doesn’t know how to surface its best content. Consider adding to popular posts some links to less popular but equally valuable content. This will combat the filter bubble and help expose readers to good stuff they may otherwise miss.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Slideshows are a dangerous game. They are almost guaranteed to turn your steady daily traffic into a big spike. If even half your daily visitors go through even half a 20-slide show, you’re doing five times your usual traffic that day. If you’re not careful, you risk becoming known as the slideshow site, instead of the news site.</p>
<p>If you insist on building slideshows, use myriad internal links to point your slideshow viewers to your substantive content. Better yet, work with in-house or outside developers to automate internal links to archive pages. For example, if you run a site about New York, the first time the name “Michael Bloomberg” appears in an article, your content management system could auto-generate a link to a page listing all articles mentioning his name.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sorry to mislead you, but I’m only to going to talk about one. Slideshows often have numbers in the headline by definition. That is one explanation for why they’re so popular. People like headlines with numbers, as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quick search for “numbers in headlines”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will illustrate.</p>
<p>I don’t advocate making every article a list. In fact, that’s a terrible idea, at least for news sites. But it’s worth incorporating numbers into headlines where it doesn’t look forced. For example, instead of “CEOs cite multiple syngeries as key to upcoming merger,” try “3 reasons Hospital 1 and Hospital 2 are merging, straight from the CEOs.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Maybe topics clearly within your site’s wheelhouse don’t perform well, no matter how many headlines, reporters or A/B tested tweets you use to produce and market them. This may simply mean the audience for those topics is substantially smaller than your broader audience. Don’t wait for the audience to find you.</p>
<p>I had great success finding an audience for some very niche stories because I sought it out on Reddit, in web forums, in Google+ Communities, with Twitter hashtags and more. The idea is that there are groups of people who self-select for interest in topics otherwise lacking broad appeal. Those audiences are smaller, but they are also more engaged, so the time spent finding them is worth it.</p>
<p>These are just examples, and the problems differ from site to site. But I think they explain the value and the limits of metrics in evaluating and improving editorial strategy at digital publications.</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First, when fitness tracking app Moves was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->acquired by Facebook<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in April, it said:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>CNET <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reported<!-- raw HTML omitted --> almost identical language from Facebook:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today, in an updated <!-- raw HTML omitted -->privacy policy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Moves said:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I suppose the updated policy doesn’t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->technically<!-- raw HTML omitted --> contradict the statements by Moves and Facebook because it’s feasible there were no plans <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at that time<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to commingle data with Facebook. But my initial reaction was incredulity.</p>
<p>After all, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wall Street Journal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reported<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Moves had been downloaded 4 million times. Surely Mark Zuckerberg acquired Moves <!-- raw HTML omitted -->primarily for<!-- raw HTML omitted --> its ever-growing trove of user activity data. Why else?</p>
<p>But none of the coverage questioned the initial statements, and I figured the companies wouldn’t say it so plainly if it wasn’t true. So I decided to wait and see.</p>
<p>Well, I’ve waited and seen. The lesson here is that it is wiser to pay attention only to what a company <!-- raw HTML omitted -->does<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not what it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->says<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If it looks like a data grab and smells like a data grab, it’s probably a data grab. Even if, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->especially if<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, someone tells you it isn’t a data grab.</p>
<p>Facebook deals in data, whether its hundreds of millions of users know it or care about it or not. And Moves would be stupid not to take the money and, more importantly, the resources Facebook can bring to bear on improving the app. So a data grab isn’t a surprise. Perhaps the “no commingling” language was an elegant public relations play meant to minimize privacy concerns in the press. That would seem to have worked: as of this article’s publication I couldn’t find a single story on the change.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recently stated intent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to grow via the acquisition and development of discreet apps and services raises another interesting issue. To quit Facebook, it may not be enough anymore to, well, quit Facebook. If I closed my Facebook account today, the company could still gather data about me for as long as I use Moves. Facebook has a growing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->list of acquisitions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> under its belt, so that concern is likely to increase with time.</p>
<p>This example of corporate self-contradiction is a good reminder: Always assume your data is a valuable and transferable commodity in the eyes and on the servers of the apps and services you use. Some people are deterred by that fact, while others are not. There is no right or wrong answer, just a continuum of personal comfort and preference.</p>
<p>While I wish the companies had been more forthright from the beginning, I won’t stop using Moves. I have personally always been relatively open in sharing data in exchange for convenience and utility. But that doesn’t mean I’m not alarmed by the increasing difficulty of using the internet and related apps and services for those who disagree with my position on openness.</p>

			 <p>This began as a link post pointing to Joel Achenbach’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Washington Post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> blog entry <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Journalism is aggregation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But, like more and more link posts lately, it got away from me and merged into its own article.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Achenbach decides journalism is aggregation, and that’s okay. Or maybe he decides it’s not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> aggregation, or that it’s at an acceptable point along the continuum between valueless aggregation and value-adding aggregation. I’m not actually sure he settled on a conclusion, and that’s okay, too.</p>
<p>Achenbach had reminded me of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my recent post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the topic, which prompted the author of the post I was commenting about to leave me <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a nice comment<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of his own. (So meta!)</p>
<p>And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->then<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this post by Joshua Benton<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nieman Journalism Lab<!-- raw HTML omitted --> expressing some disappointment with Achenbach’s aforementioned lack of a conclusion, or more precisely paints his conclusion as a bit of backtracking. I’m not sure I agree with Benton’s take, but both men raise interesting points.</p>
<p>Some journalism is aggregation, but most <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and all <!-- raw HTML omitted -->great<!-- raw HTML omitted --> journalism is more than mere aggregation. It’s a synthesis of the anecdotes, data, facts and perspectives of as many reliable sources as you can fit into your word limit. Right? That’s an accurate description of much of the best journalism I’ve read in the past year or two.</p>
<p>To me, pure aggregation on the web involves sharing a link and perhaps pairing it with an inflammatory or vapid comment. Sometimes, that’s actually fine with me. Twitter is a good example of that. But no one would call it journalism, even when journalists do it. That’s important to keep in mind, I think: not everything a journalist does online or off is, or is intended as, journalism.</p>
<p>Achenbach wrote about the interview process, which most journalists use to offer different perspectives on a piece of news from experts of different disciplines or schools of thought. Interviews, collecting the commentary of multiple sources, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted --> an aggregation of those opinions. But that’s just one activity in the composite of activities which together compose an act of “journalism.” The result is an article in which, as Achenbach also says near the end of his post, the reporter has drawn on personal knowledge, research and experience <!-- raw HTML omitted -->beyond the interviews and facts aggregated.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Aggregation, then, is the collection and presentation of opinions or facts, adding little or no context. Journalism, I think, is an equation like this:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Journalism = aggregation + context<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I want to know what you would add to, or remove from, that equation. I realize that aggregation on the web generally, and as an issue in digital journalism and publishing specifically, predates my humble blog posts on the topic, but I want to explore it with other interested folks.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note: I’m not your lawyer, you’re not my client, and nothing in this article is, or should be construed as, legal advice.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Companies that don’t sell anything and exist only to enforce patent rights, sometimes purchased from the original patent holder solely for the value of enforcement, are known as non-practicing entities (NPEs) or, pejoratively by defendant companies and their attorneys, “patent trolls.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The NPE will sue claiming infringement of one or more patents, and may not actually have any intent to litigate. Many companies and inventors of all sizes regard NPEs scornfully, but are often forced to play ball because settlement is almost always cheaper than litigation. For smaller startups, the cost of litigation may even pose an existential threat.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Allow me to play devil’s advocate for a bit. I consider most NPEs parasites, siphoning money out of the market in return for nothing at all. But here are some thoughts on what some of them may be doing wrong from their own perspective. After all, what good is an attorney who can’t think like his enemy?</p>
<p>Let me explain some basic corporate law, as much for my recollection as for your edification. A corporation is subject to the law of the state in which it incorporates, and corporate law differs from state to state. The cases I cite below only illustrate the foundational principles of corporate statutory and common law.</p>
<p>A company’s board directors and officers owe several fiduciary duties to shareholders and the company itself. One of those is the duty of care, which says that responsibility for “the financial interests of others imposes on a director an affirmative duty to protect those interests.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>However, courts realize businesspersons are in a better position than judges and attorneys to make sound decisions for their companies. For that reason, courts often defer to the judgment of a company’s leadership absent some gross negligence.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The business judgment rule, as it is called, is at its core :</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thus, the fiduciary duty of care owed to shareholders by directors and officers requires them to make a “good faith effort to be informed and exercise judgment.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So, now back to the NPEs. When a company faces suit by an NPE, its leaders are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->obligated<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to compare the costs of litigation and settlement and choose the path most protective of the company’s and shareholders’ interests, which is usually the less costly path. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, of course, is almost always settlement.</p>
<p>Joe Mullin, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->writing for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ars Technica<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, explains the financial position of an NPE recently vanquished by web-based tech retailer Newegg:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That $50,000 happens to match the low-end of the amount MacroSolve demanded of companies against which it brought patent infringement lawsuits. In other words, it matched its settlement demands to its burn rate.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->6<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It was actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->surviving<!-- raw HTML omitted --> only, or primarily, by threatening to go to trial on patent claims of dubious validity. MacroSolve is a public company, so much of their financial and operational information is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->openly available<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Newegg realized after reviewing that information that MacroSolve’s burn rate matched the settlement demands, and built a strategy around it: call the MacroSolve bluff, revealed by their public financials, by refusing to settle, causing their burn rate to deplete cash-on-hand and substantially reduce or totally eliminate the company’s ability to press on with any outstanding litigation.</p>
<p>NPEs registered as private companies and considering the MacroSolve strategy may be safer staying private. Public companies may want to consider <!-- raw HTML omitted -->taking the company private<!-- raw HTML omitted --> before using litigation or threat of litigation, on the assumption that some percentage of defendants will settle, to fund the company’s survival.</p>
<p>In conclusion, patent litigation by non-practicing entities is even more a game of poker than most litigation, to the extent the defendant isn’t really infringing or the patent’s validity is assailable, and public companies show too much of their hand too much of the time to play safely under most corporate law regimes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->7<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

		<a href="https://joeross.me/2014/03/12/popcorn-time-streams.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-03-12 07:07:00 -0500">Mar 12, 2014</time></a>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The image above is the first screen you see when you open <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Popcorn Time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The app, available on Mac, Windows and Linux, streams movies from the peer-to-peer file sharing protocol <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BitTorrent<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The technology is similar to what old school music swapping service Napster used from about 1999 to 2001, before being shut down.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It’s getting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a lot of attention<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this week, much of which focuses on its copyright infringement implications. And for good reason, because according to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FAQ<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, while you’re watching a movie, the app is using your computer and internet connection to seed the same movie to other viewers. That means you’re sharing what you’re watching, and if what you’re watching is copyrighted or otherwise protected by your country’s intellectual property laws, you may be committing a civil violation or a crime.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s like that.</p>
<p>I messaged the Buenos Aires-based developers of Popcorn Time <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on Facebook<!-- raw HTML omitted --> asking whether they would consider adding a Creative Commons / Public Domain channel to the app. It couldn’t hurt to include some non-infringing content, and it may be a cool new way for indie filmmakers to distribute their work.</p>
<p>But while copyright infringement is the easy story (and the one I would <!-- raw HTML omitted -->usually<!-- raw HTML omitted --> focus on here), there’s a more interesting angle to Popcorn Time.</p>
<p>It has the potential to introduce “normals” to the concept of peer-to-peer file sharing. This is similar to what BitCoin has done to the idea of digital currency. While it is the first <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cryptocurrency<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, using cryptography to secure transactions, it was not the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first<!-- raw HTML omitted --> digital currency. Several video games allow players to trade items for virtual money and have done so for a long time.</p>
<p>But BitCoin brought the concept to the forefront of an international conversation. I’m not sure Popcorn Time is going to be that big or game-changing (it’s still in beta; only the third movie I tried to play, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->American Hustle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, actually began to play. I turned it off right away, because it’s good policy for would-be attorneys not to, you know, break laws).</p>
<p>I do think there is real value to a proof of concept when it gets a technology usually limited to geeks into the hands of a larger audience.</p>
<p>And the infringement potential doesn’t have to be a deal-breaker. A quick Google search for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->legitimate uses of BitTorrent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> turns up about 146,000 results.</p>
<p>Some totally legal uses of BitTorrent include game <!-- raw HTML omitted -->updates and downloads<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, distributing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->your own music<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and (take note, Popcorn Time developers) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->public domain movie trading<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So the question is whether the extra attention Popcorn Time is getting can be turned toward the lawful uses of peer-to-peer protocols. If so, it could be the boost the system needs to become a permanent fixture in the national conversation. In other words, the interest in Popcorn Time could be peer-to-peer’s BitCoin moment.</p>

			 <p>I’m a huge fan of apps and services like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instapaper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pocket<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which allow you to save web pages, articles and even videos for later. Whether I’m in line at a coffee shop or sitting in a waiting room, I often turn to tools like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to see what’s worth reading on any given day. The combination of all of those apps leaves me with far more content than I can read in a day, but I’m going to start sharing what I get to in a daily post over here.</p>
<p>This will serve two purposes. First, it will give you a sense of what I look at every day. Second, it will give me a convenient way to look for patterns in what I’m actually choosing to read versus the much larger bucket of things I’m saving. In other words, some of the stuff I save I will never, ever read. And maybe I’m repetitive or restricting myself to an echo-chamber of similar perspectives. This exercise will help me look for those things and then change them.</p>
<p>Most will be far shorter than this one, but in the spirit of getting off to a good start, here’s a list from the last couple of days:</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I focused in the first of this three-post series on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how I capture<!-- raw HTML omitted --> information for use at home, work, for study, and in creative pursuits. This article is part two in that series, where I’ll spend about 500 words talking about how I name, organize, and save files across several platforms and devices.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextExpander<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on OS X and iOS devices. TextExpander probably fits into all three categories, but I put it in Catalog because I use it overwhelmingly to name and tag files. It’s not free, but it’s worth every cent if you find yourself typing the same things over and over again.</p>
<p>You can attach frequently used snippets of text to shortcuts like “ddate,” which automatically expands to “January 20, 2014” the moment you type it. I like to prepend the date to new the blog posts I draft as text files, so I made a TextExpander snippet that expands “.dnb” to “140120.blog.” and then I can add a name after the second period. So the file I drafted this post in is called 140119.blog.Workflow.txt, but all I had to type was “.dnb Workflow.”</p>
<p>That file name is also a big and relatively new part of how I catalog stuff. Computers can change the date they attach to a file based on when it was modified, when it was downloaded, or for other reasons. So I append the creation date to every file I make, formatted as a 2-digit year, 2-digit month and 2-digit day. Then, a period (many people use a dash, it’s a matter of taste) and the type of file it is, like blog, work, fic for fiction. You get the idea. The third component is the title, with multiple words</p>
<p>I find a new use for TextExpander every day, so it’s vital not only to working productively today, but to working even more productively in the future.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dropbox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I use primarily to store files I’m manipulating across different devices. Images I edit and store for work, documents I need to share with people who don’t use Google Drive, and the text files in my /Notes folder, where I draft everything I write, all get synchronized across my home, work and laptop computers. With Dropbox mobile apps and the widespread integration of the service by third-party apps and services, there’s never a problem accessing the most up-to-date version of what I’m working on, whether I’m online or off.</p>
<p>Evernote, which I mentioned in my Capture post and about which I’ll write a more in-depth post eventually, is also great for cataloging after you’ve captured stuff. I tend to use Evernote only when there is email or multimedia involved, sticking to plain text notes in Dropbox for regular old writing tasks. But when email or multimedia are involved, Evernote can’t be beat.</p>
<p>I have a notebook for music, where I tag notes lyrics or audio or both. I have another notebook for finance, where I store and tag all my emailed receipts and other financial bits. I even have a notebook for recipes, which I can share with my wife so we can collect stuff as we find it. Evernote “stacks” even let you make what is essentially a notebook of notebooks.</p>
<p>Much of the work over at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evernote Blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> focuses on how to catalog with the app, so check it out if you’re interested. But I usually start my cataloging workflow in my default notebook, which I’ve labelled Inbox, since I’m so used to processing incoming email from that label.</p>
<p>Since we want capture to be as friction-free as possible, I just save into my default notebook. Then, a few times a week, when I need some mindless busywork to do, I’ll dive into my Inbox notebook and start moving and tagging. Sometimes, I realize I don’t really need something and delete it altogether. I highly recommend the default-now, process-later approach so that using apps like Evernote in the field isn’t cumbersome or time consuming.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I could go on forever about this stuff, but the basic system I use for cataloging is a naming convention when it comes to plain text and a notebook + tags system when it comes to images, PDF, and audio in Evernote. I’m sure everyone’s different so feel free to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->contact me on Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and tell me about your workflow.</p>

			 <p>This post stems from my recent conversations with a few people I know and care about who are having a very hard time of things these days.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Each of us have our own mountains to climb, our own monsters under the bed. Mostly, it’s a different battle for all of us. But there’s a common thread. I notice it while I’m trying to give advice to one person, while trying like hell just to get in touch with another, and while trying to stay as quiet as I can while the heart of a third breaks a little more every day:</p>
<p>However close we are to someone, there’s always a part of them we can’t help.</p>
<p>That part always, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->always<!-- raw HTML omitted --> goes alone into whatever minor annoyance, mundane problem or massive tragedy we face. It’s the part no one can follow, carry or comfort. Those outside your mind can’t know that part of you, and you can’t know it in them. But we all have it.</p>
<p>And we have to treat it differently from the other parts, the bits of someone we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reach, the bits that need encouragement or a listener or someone sitting next to them in mutually acceptable and comfortable silence.</p>
<p>The part that goes alone can only be recognized and respected, and that’s really, really difficult to accept when all you want to do is help someone.</p>
<p>Happiness and sadness are equal parts chemicals and circumstances, but understanding someone and making them <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> understood, even when that means accepting you can’t completely relieve them of their burdens, is an art worth pursuing.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ed. note: This article was originally published in 2007 at Phillyist, the now-closed website about arts and culture in Philadelphia at which I was an associate editor. I’m republishing it here, lightly revised, for Veteran’s Day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It’s never easy to watch friends depart for dangerous lands, but it’s comforting to know they are members of the United States Marine Corps.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That does not mean that, when my good friend, whom I met during my first year in college, when we roomed together, and who asked to remain anonymous, deployed on his first tour of duty, I was all smiles.</p>
<p>The sad reality is that, however well-trained, equipped and capable our soldiers are, many of our generation’s battles are fundamentally unique. Direct person-to-person combat is sometimes taken out of the equation, replaced by death squads and pockets of insurgency that blend into civilian neighborhoods, sometimes by force and sometimes with the permission of villagers.</p>
<p>Classic guerrilla tactics have given way to makeshift but deadly improvised explosive devices (IEDs), sometimes detonated by trip wire and sometimes set off via radio remote.</p>
<p>When my friend returned home from about a year in Iraq, he had many stories to tell. There was, however, one in particular that illustrated the brutal moral difficulty that faces so many of our soldiers.</p>
<p>My friend, a native of New Jersey who attended the same Philadelphia-area university that I did, was stationed almost directly between the cities of Fallujah and Ramadi in central Iraq.</p>
<p>For a while, he and his comrades were posted on a bridge (the one pictured above) that fed an exit ramp across the Euphrates river. This was a highway that had been in disuse since the start of the conflict and the Marines were involved in an effort to return use of the bridge to civilians in the area.</p>
<p>To that end, they moved their post off of the bridge to a site 500 meters away. However, in the weeks following this decision, about a dozen IEDs were placed on or below the bridge, although two ever detonated.</p>
<p>It is a fairly common tactic among insurgents, he told me, to send children in with these potential IEDs, usually in the form of small knapsacks or bookbags. The idea is that if the Marines don’t open fire on the child with the decoy bag, the next child will be sent in to deliver a real bomb. Some children are suckered into this or bribed, others go willingly with a terrifyingly adult devotion to their cause.</p>
<p>My friend was patrolling with a sniper company one day, not long after  the two real bombs had gone off. The trigger man spotted a child approaching the underside of the bridge.</p>
<p>The sniper, following new orders the company had received in the wake of the two recently detonated IEDs, lined up a shot and took it, instantly killing the child.</p>
<p>Further invesigation revealed that the bag the child had been carrying was empty.</p>
<p>This tragic illustration of what has happened and may still happen in Iraq and Afghanistan is not the only story my friend had. There was the eight-year-old boy who approached a patrol of Iraqi army officers and US Marines, begging for water. He quickly triggered a bomb vest he had been wearing under his clothes and took the lives of five servicemen, as well as his own. There was the other young boy who drove a car bomb up to a local school, killing himself and a dozen other children.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most disturbing part of the conversation I had with my friend about these stories was how he told them. We discussed the sad sickness of a war that involves children, but he made clear, in the field, second-guesses are dangerous luxuries.</p>
<p>We can only wonder, from this side of war, what these situations are doing to men and women who fight them for us. The statistics are daunting, but this is not that kind of article. Making men and women into numbers is part of the problem.</p>
<p>Let’s try to keep in mind, not only on Memorial or Veterans days, what exactly it means to serve your country, and that sometimes, even if someone returns physically unharmed, they may not have survived unscathed.</p>
<p>They do not confine their service to one or two days a year, and we must not so limit our gratitude. It is a debt we cannot repay, but we must never stop trying.</p>

			 <p>The National Security Agency, in a mass email to press Oct. 31, presumably responding to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a recent Washington Post report<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the agency’s direct data monitoring of company’s like Google and Yahoo, goes all third-person self-referential on us:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Read the rest of the statement:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Oct. 31, 2013</p>
<p>Recent press articles on NSA’s collection operations conducted under Executive Order 12333 have misstated facts, mischaracterized NSA’s activities, and drawn erroneous inferences about those operations.  NSA conducts all of its activities in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies – and assertions to the contrary do a grave disservice to the nation, its allies and partners, and the men and women who make up the National Security Agency.</p>
<p>All NSA intelligence activities start with a validated foreign intelligence requirement, initiated by one or more Executive Branch intelligence consumers, and are run through a process managed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  When those requirements are received by NSA, analysts look at the Information Need and determine the best way to satisfy it.  That process involves identifying the foreign entities that have the information, researching how they communicate, and determining how best to access those communications in order to get the foreign intelligence information.  The analysts identify selectors – e-mail addresses and phone numbers are examples – that help isolate the communications of the foreign entity and task those to collection systems.  In those cases where there are not specific selectors available, the analysts will use metadata, similar to the address on the outside of an envelope, to attempt to develop selectors for their targets.  Once they have them, they task the selectors to the collection systems in order to get access to the content, similar to the letter inside the envelope.</p>
<p>The collection systems target communications links that contain the selectors, or are to and from areas likely to contain the selectors, of foreign intelligence interest.  Seventy years ago, the communications links were shortwave radio transmissions between two points on the globe.  Today’s communications flow over technologies like satellite links, microwave towers, and fiber optic cables.   Terrorists, weapons proliferators, and other valid foreign intelligence targets make use of commercial infrastructure and services.   When a validated foreign intelligence target uses one of those means to send or receive their communications, we work to find, collect, and report on the communication.   Our focus is on targeting the communications of those targets, not on collecting and exploiting a class of communications or services that would sweep up communications that are not of bona fide foreign intelligence interest to us.</p>
<p>What NSA does is collect the communications of targets of foreign intelligence value, irrespective of the provider that carries them.  U.S. service provider communications make use of the same information super highways as a variety of other commercial service providers.  NSA must understand and take that into account in order to eliminate information that is not related to foreign intelligence.</p>
<p>NSA works with a number of partners and allies in meeting its foreign-intelligence mission goals, and in every case those operations comply with U.S. law and with the applicable laws under which those partners and allies operate.  A key part of the protections that are provided to both U.S. persons and citizens of other countries is the requirement that information be in support of a valid foreign intelligence requirement, and the Attorney General-approved minimization procedures.  These limitations protect the privacy of all people and, in particular, to any incidentally acquired communications of U.S. persons.  The protections are applied when selectors are tasked to the collection system; when the collection itself occurs; when the collected data are being processed, evaluated, analyzed, and put into a database; and when any reporting of the foreign intelligence is being done.   In addition, NSA is very motivated and actively works to remove as much extraneous data as early in the process as possible – to include data of innocent foreign citizens.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This profile of Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley by Austin Carr at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fast Company<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does a great job of humanizing the app and its maker.</p>
<p>That’s probably because the man behind the location-sharing and, more recently, stuff-to-do discovery app, has put so much of himself into Foursquare. There are many profiles written about business and tech personalities, but few intrigued as much as this one does.</p>
<p>I think it’s because Carr really communicates how Crowley is finding himself at a cross-roads not only with Foursquare as a company, but with his life’s direction and essence.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wrote the article below for Temple Law’s student newspaper, Prima Facie. While my views on the topic of copyright liability in the modern Internet’s “sharing economy” continue to evolve, I haven’t made any edits to the version that ran in Prima’s April issue. This is a long post, but I would welcome any feedback, including criticism as long as it’s constructive. I also include a postscript at the bottom mentioning a recent development that may affect the relevant legal landscape.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Fair use doctrine is a great thing. Its allows limited use of copyrighted works and consists of four factors. Those factors include the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the work used, the amount used relative to the whole work, and the effect of the use upon the potential market for the work. These considerations, developed at common law and now included in the Copyright Act at 17 USC § 107, can be powerful tools for art, education, and other endeavors. But they are also widely misunderstood. Copyright law and fair use are in many ways more important than ever. </p>
<p>Ours is an increasingly networked world, marked by everyday activities like sharing things on Facebook and posting things to blogs. The rise of social engagement and the sharing economy has been so meteoric as to pull even the enterprise into its gravitational field. The largest companies in the world are now active on Twitter, and even the late Steve Jobs made his Apple, Inc. email address publicly known, sometimes even sending personal replies to complete strangers.</p>
<p>This is an exciting development, and harbors many of the hallmarks of what early pioneers of the public internet might call “success.” And they would be right. But the internet is a tool, and like any tool, it is only as good or as evil as the people who use it. The internet is used to spread child pornography, to pirate movies and music, and to steal massive amounts of credit card and other sensitive private information. However, somewhere between the glorious interconnection that let frustrated Apple users get the low-down from Mr. Jobs himself, and the internet’s criminal underground, there are more pedestrian, though no less important, issues for us to face.</p>
<p>Issues like Pinterest.com. Well, Pinterest isn’t the issue, the issue is still copyright law and the confusion it often causes when it comes to the internet. Legislation like 1998’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act tries to minimize the liability of service providers for the digital wrongs committed by their users. But those laws don’t (and probably shouldn’t) take similar steps to relieve the users themselves of liability for things like copyright infringement. And therein lies the complication for Pinterest. </p>
<p>The invite-only image sharing site had 11.7 million unique visitors in January 2012, according to web metrics firm comScore. Users keep an eye out for interesting or beautiful images while they’re shopping, reading news, or otherwise surfing the web. When they find something worth bookmarking, they “pin” it, building “boards” based on different topics. Earlier this year, attorney and photographer Kirsten Kowalski wrote a blog post about her misgivings: it looked to her like Pinterest users were engaging in copyright infringement on a scale never before seen. Pinterest, the internet seemed to say in unison, has a very big copyright problem.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, it’s not really Pinterest’s copyright problem. It’s Pinterest’s users copyright problem, since the DMCA and a well-worded indemnification clause in their terms of service probably get Pinterest themselves off the hook. But the problem with Kowalski’s post, and with the press and viral internet attention it got, is that the “Pinterest problem” is absolutely not on a scale never before seen. This is, in fact, how the internet works. The compliance with the DMCA and solid indemnification clauses keep companies out of hot copyright water, but users are infringing at an astounding daily rate. </p>
<p>The popular blogging service Tumblr gets around twelve billion monthly pageviews. Just Google “tumblr star wars” to get a feel for how much user infringement is going on over there. Sections 9 and 10 of Tumblr’s terms of service give them the same indemnity from claims and judgments related to use of the service that Pinterest demands. That’s because Tumblr, Facebook, and others have been around for years, doing exactly what Pinterest does: enabling (and often profiting, directly or indirectly, from) infringement. Publishers often let it go because the traffic and mindshare they derive from this rampant sharing is more valuable to them than the hunt-and-peck game of suing individual infringers. In reality, users agree to assume massive liability in return for the use of myriad blogging services every day, and they have been for a very, very long time. </p>
<p>Pinterest has developed a snippet of website code they refer to as a “nopin” tag that copyright owners can include on their own websites to block Pinterest users from displaying their content via Pinterest. It’s a gesture of goodwill from Pinterest to rights holders, and popular photo sharing site Flickr has made the “nopin” tag an option for its own copyright-holding users. But there’s a better way to empower users to share than mere reliance on the continued laissez-faire legal strategies of publishers and ad hoc website tags.</p>
<p>This brings us back to fair use, the doctrine mentioned at the beginning of this article. Many misconstrue fair use as a right to use someone else’s work regardless of copyright. That’s not what it is at all, though. It is an affirmative defense, only marshaled when a defendant essentially admits to infringing a §106 right. You admit the infringement, but then assert a fair use defense. Under current law, fair use never “excuses” or “permits” infringement ex ante.</p>
<p>But maybe it should.</p>
<p>Maybe copyright law should be modified to make fair use an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a priori<!-- raw HTML omitted --> right of the public to use, with certain limitations and restrictions, the copyrighted works of others. That doesn’t mean that Pinterest users would be off the hook, and commercial companies running their own Pinterest boards will always be more likely to draw negative attention from rights holders in copyright as well as trademark and “use of likeness” issues. Users are required to comply with current law.</p>
<p>But fair use as a right instead of an affirmative defense would reduce the chilling effect overbroad copyright law sometimes has, and would facilitate the growth of the sharing economy that has come to define the modern internet.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Postscript:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Porn publisher Perfect 10 has sued Tumblr over the many copies of its copyrighted photos the blogging service allegedly stores on its servers. Note that they’re not suing Pinterest, despite its recent surge in popularity. As I said, what many call the “Pinterest problem” predates Pinterest, and as today’s news suggests, it might be more aptly termed the “Tumblr problem.” Read Jeff John Roberts’ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post at paidContent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for more information.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
