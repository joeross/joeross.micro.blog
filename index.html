			 <p>Laurens Hof, writing in <a href="https://fediversereport.com/last-week-in-fediverse-ep-73-and-72/">Episode 73 of his Last Week in Fediverse newsletter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes the situation with rumours of Mastodon leaking private messages so interesting to me is that the original posts that contained the rumours got significantly more engagement than the corrections. So it seems to me that the structural feature of decentralised networks that ‘significantly limits the reach of fake news’ can also work to limit the reach of corrections to fake news as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good point, but the structural aspect of decentralized networks that makes it as difficult to circulate corrections as it is to circulate fake news is susceptible to some white hat manipulation. To paraphrase a misquote/cliché, we have to be the circulation we wish to see in the network.</p>
<p>Decentralization significantly reduces virality, allowing users to more carefully control the spread of information. We can spread corrections effectively, it just takes effort.</p>
<p>I don’t have a solution, but here’s something ive been thinking about: Perhaps there is some way of building corrections into ActivityPub as a special type of edit that triggers a notification to users who interacted with the original post.</p>
<p>I would advocate for making this mechanism opt-out to maximize the flow of corrections, but I know that may be naïve, and that perhaps I’m ignorant of the likelihood that some would find a way to abuse such a tool to spread fake news after all. It’s a fun thought experiment, and I’m open to discussing with other nerds who think about this stuff at weird hours of the night when they should be sleeping.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m in a weird headspace about the Supreme Court&rsquo;s right wing wearing their partiality on their sleeves. I’m supposed to be mad about it, like lots of liberals. But I think it’s a kind of honesty and, in its hubris, exposes the vulnerabilities of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/09/revolutionary-conservative-legal-philosophy-courts-00069201">the right’s more longterm</a> jurisprudential projects.</p>
<p>(<em>Takes a deep breath, hopes people read all the way through, or at least halfway through&hellip;</em>)</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m talking about the most recent example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/justice-alito-upside-down-flag.html">reported by Jodi Kantor</a> at <em>The New York Times</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judicial experts said in interviews that the flag was a clear violation of ethics rules, which seek to avoid even the appearance of bias, and could sow doubt about Justice Alito&rsquo;s impartiality in cases related to the election and the Capitol riot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been several developments since I first started writing this post in mid-May when the upside flag story first broke. None of those developments changes my perspective. In fact, they all reinforce it. Anyway, to catch up and stay caught up on the Alito/flags stuff and all else SCOTUS, I recommend reading the work of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/profiles/john-fritze">John Fritze at <em>CNN</em></a>, <a href="https://www.lawdork.com">Chris Geidner&rsquo;s <em>Law Dork</em></a>, and the <a href="https://slate.com/tag/supreme-court">SCOTUS team at <em>Slate</em></a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as worked up about this one because it doesn&rsquo;t involve direct or indirect financial incentives, or a spouse inserting themselves, however superfluously, into schemes resembling a coup. And it shouldn&rsquo;t change the assumptions of anyone who has been paying attention to Alito for the past many years. Yes, it&rsquo;s infuriating and concerning and beyond anything I would hope for our highest court. But it&rsquo;s not a surprise.</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t believe he didn&rsquo;t know about the flag hanging <em>outside his house</em>, or its meaning as a sign of solidarity with &ldquo;stop the steal&rdquo; whackos, and of course, blaming your spouse in the national press is&hellip; a choice, and of course &ldquo;my neighbors were teasing me first&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t an appropriate reaction for a Supreme Court justice to the political speech of his neighbors, however performative and counterproductive that speech may be.</p>
<p>But the handwringing over this flag episode is based on the idea that anyone paying attention could take seriously the proposition that Alito lacks bias or could possibly be impartial in cases related to the election and the Capitol riot, or really any issue of importance to, eh, people of his political ilk. Impartial people, and people worried about at least appearing impartial, do not <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/11/at-federalist-society-convention-alito-says-religious-liberty-gun-ownership-are-under-attack/">give the keynote speech</a> at Federalist Society conventions.</p>
<p>(Nor do they <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/05/supreme-court-south-carolina-redistricting-ruling-clarence-thomas-brown-v-board.html">inveigh wholeheartedly against a Constitution protective of the rights of all Americans</a>, but that is beyond the scope of this post…)</p>
<p>Usually, this is where I would admit my own outsize portion of cynicism, and caution Dear Readers to consider this screed in that light, but this time I do the opposite: the fact is, the suggestion that Alito has any impartiality to preserve is, at this point, blatantly dishonest or an inadvertent admission of naïveté. As just one recent example, he openly treats the First Amendment as if it applies to conduct by private companies moderating their users' speech (it does not) and then has to be <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/02/free-speech-internet-big-tech-scotus-case.html">called out on it</a> by Justice Kavanaugh.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;m going to say something (else?) people may not like, and that I may regret someday:</p>
<p>I actually appreciate Alito&rsquo;s intellectual honesty, though query whether it’s deliberate or the result of too much rhetorical laziness to be more insidious about his intentions. Because <em>there are</em> more measured, insidious ways to drag the nation backward, under the guise of faith to the Constitution <em>qua</em> <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/the-history-of-history-and-tradition-the-roots-of-dobbss-method-and-originalism-in-the-defense-of-segregation">“history and tradition”</a>, as close as posible to a time when people who looked like Alito, and me, for that matter, held all the power, and there was no immediate risk of having to share it.</p>
<p>History and tradition, indeed.</p>

<p>Tripp Mickle, Brian X. Chen and Cade Metz report at <em>The New York Times</em> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision came after the executives Craig Federighi and John Giannandrea spent weeks testing OpenAI&rsquo;s new chatbot, ChatGPT. The product&rsquo;s use of generative artificial intelligence, which can write poetry, create computer code and answer complex questions, made Siri look antiquated, said two people familiar with the company&rsquo;s work, who didn&rsquo;t have permission to speak publicly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple can&rsquo;t be serious here. My earliest <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> recipes made Siri look antiquated. Siri has been, to put it as politely as Siri deserves, trash for years. The user experience of the earliest <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo">Echo Auto</a> was head and shoulders above Siri. If you need a reminder set, Siri will work more often than not. But that&rsquo;s been its only viable use case since release.</p>
<p>Apple has been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apples-plans-to-bring-artificial-intelligence-to-your-phone/">marketing off of machine learning since 2018</a> and probably earlier, so it&rsquo;s just bonkers that they didn&rsquo;t decide to scrap Siri at least that long ago and turn their machine learning resources toward something better.</p>

<p>The best part about the 32-Bit Cafe is that we&rsquo;re trying to move the internet forward productively in the ways we can make an impact, participating in the creation of web services, websites, and weird, wacky web projects. We want to bring back the idea of personal websites to the many of us who have been stuck in social media cycles since the emergence of Web 2.0. Not to mention, we&rsquo;re not just helping people build their first websites; we&rsquo;re also making our own hosted services for anyone to use and participate in to help with decentralizing hosted services.</p>

<p>Jarrod Blundy wrote <a href="https://heydingus.net/blog/2024/1/artifact-shuts-down-just-as-i-was-getting-into-it">at his blog HeyDingus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do wonder if it would have had a brighter future <em>without</em> the ability to add comments. I never engaged with that social aspect of the service, and I expect it contributed massively to its complexity and moderation costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think about this every time a good news or link aggregation app goes away. These apps are, fundamentally, trying to help you sort the signal from the noise in an overwhelming &ldquo;media ecosystem&rdquo; or whatever we&rsquo;re supposed to call it these days.</p>
<p>As soon as they add their own social layer on top of the news and the links, they have betrayed their best use case and their most loyal users. It&rsquo;s like buying a pair of earplugs, only to have them turn into in-ear headphones or hearing aides you don&rsquo;t need and never asked for.</p>
<p>Engagement, which they thought would spike after going social, craters. Resources, which were optimized and sufficient and scalable with increasing revenue over time, are siphoned off, as Jarrod wrote, into moderation and increasingly complex development cycles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of death spiral that most founders notice too late, so kudos, of a sort, to Artifact&rsquo;s founders for knowing the telltale signs of a terminally ill app, and letting it die with some dignity.</p>
<p>There are already plenty of places to share links and half-baked hot takes. The real challenge, for Artifact&rsquo;s founders and anyone else with the leadership, technical and fundraising skills to tackle it, is to build something extremely useful to individuals <em>without draining all of its lifeblood into a push for &ldquo;social&rdquo;</em> that ultimately just turns it into another internet noise machine.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780062406781">Charlotte&rsquo;s Web</a> by E. B. White 📚 — ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Skip and dance, jump and prance! Go down through the orchard and stroll in the woods! The world is a wonderful place when you’re young.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sure is.</p>
<p>What a hell of an amazing book to relegate to the unjustly dismissed &ldquo;children&rsquo;s&rdquo; shelves. This book gets five stars, no question about it.</p>
<p>White manages to address, in my opinion, so many of The Important Things We All Should Learn About Rather Young If Possible, including misogyny/clueless men, bullies, transactional acquaintances, competition, the joy and sorrow of freedom, the dilemma of the naive but intelligent, parenting (well, let&rsquo;s be honest, mostly motherhood), the distinction between pathology and an innocent&rsquo;s rational-from-their-perspective perceptions, the rarity and value of adults who are aware of the immediately preceding concept (like the inimitable Dr. Dorian), evolution, religion, birth and death, and, of course, the intergenerational power of real, no-but-seriously-really-real friendship that reaches out beyond its originators and enriches those who come after, in ways known and unknown, for years or decades to come.</p>
<p>Like I said, just a hell of a book.</p>

			 <p>Here’s a reply I posted to someone I follow on Mastodon who, on being issued an iPhone by their employer for work calls, was wondering why anyone chooses it over other options when, for example, it’s hard to sideload something as simple as a custom ringtone:</p>
<p>Look I need guardrails and I’ve known that ever since I was bopping around the command line on my HTC Evo 4G.</p>
<p>Some of us stopped headbanging not because the music left our hearts, but because if you feel something too deeply for too long it can destroy you.</p>
<p>That’s what was happening to me in the bowels of my root-and-rom addiction.</p>
<p>Now I pay 0.99 for a ringtone to Tim Apple and say thank you sir may I have another because I’m safe from sudo-ing on my phone.</p>

			 <p>I was listening to <a href="https://celesteheadlee.com/">Celeste Headlee</a> interview <a href="https://www.anildash.com/">Anil Dash</a> on the <a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/what-next-tbd/2023/08/techs-white-supremacist-reactionary-problem">latest episode</a> of the Slate podcast <a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/what-next-tbd">What Next: TBD</a>, and Dash said something about the kind of web communities we should build, and encourage, to combat the rise of white supremacy among wealthy and influential tech leaders and the communities they fund:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we make there be a community that has its own recipes and how many of the apps you use every day are home cooked meals made by somebody you love in a community that you’re from? It can be that, it’s happening again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This immediately struck me as a perfect description of what I like about <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://home.omg.lol">Omg.lol</a>. Each is made by a <a href="https://adam.omg.lol/">person</a> or a <a href="https://micro.blog/about">small team</a> who are constantly involved in the community, who we can report bugs to, suggest features to, or just chat with, and who greet criticism head-on with clear explanations of why they hold their positions, and who maintain a willingness to change their minds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re perfect &ndash; after all, like you and I, they&rsquo;re <em>people</em>, so of course they&rsquo;re not perfect. But that&rsquo;s just it: they&rsquo;re <em>people</em>, and they treat their users like they&rsquo;re people, too.</p>
<p>We get all of this because we pay a really, <em>really</em> reasonable fee to join these communities, relieving them of the need to pursue increasingly questionable methods of revenue generation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the web worth paying for, and I&rsquo;m happy to be here.</p>

			 <p>So, 40 commits later, you can star my insomnia <a href="https://github.com/joeross/QuickLinks/">on GitHub</a>. I should have been cleaning, or sleeping. Instead, I made <a href="https://joeross.dev/quicklinks">a webpage</a>. Then I made <a href="https://joeross.dev/quicklinks/sametab">a second webpage</a>, identical to the first, except links open in the same tab, for all the weirdos out there who like that sort of thing.</p>
