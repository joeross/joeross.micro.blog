I suspect I'm not the only one, and that's probably what catalyzed this feature. \n\nI have vacillated for a while between Kagi, Startpage, DuckDuckGo, and Brave Search -- search engine comparison is the new to-do app comparison for my dopamine-starved brain. Kagi feels superior to the others, but even at $5, I‚Äôm just not sure the value sufficiently exceeds what I can do with the others, given the right ad blockers and keyboard incantations.\n\n \n",

None of those developments changes my perspective. In fact, they all reinforce it. Anyway, to catch up and stay caught up on the Alito/flags stuff and all else SCOTUS, I recommend reading the work of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/profiles/john-fritze\">John Fritze at <em>CNN</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.lawdork.com\">Chris Geidner&rsquo;s <em>Law Dork</em></a>, and the <a href=\"https://slate.com/tag/supreme-court\">SCOTUS team at <em>Slate</em></a>.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not as worked up about this one because it doesn&rsquo;t involve direct or indirect financial incentives, or a spouse inserting themselves, however superfluously, into schemes resembling a coup.

				"content_text": "I'm in a weird headspace about the Supreme Court's right wing wearing their partiality on their sleeves. I‚Äôm supposed to be mad about it, like lots of liberals. But I think it‚Äôs a kind of honesty and, in its hubris, exposes the vulnerabilities of [the right‚Äôs more longterm](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/09/revolutionary-conservative-legal-philosophy-courts-00069201) jurisprudential projects.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n(_Takes a deep breath, hopes people read all the way through, or at least halfway through..._)\n\nObviously, I'm talking about the most recent example, [reported by Jodi Kantor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/justice-alito-upside-down-flag.html) at _The New York Times_:\n\n> Judicial experts said in interviews that the flag was a clear violation of ethics rules, which seek to avoid even the appearance of bias, and could sow doubt about Justice Alito's impartiality in cases related to the election and the Capitol riot.\n\nThere have been several developments since I first started writing this post in mid-May when the upside flag story first broke. None of those developments changes my perspective. In fact, they all reinforce it. Anyway, to catch up and stay caught up on the Alito/flags stuff and all else SCOTUS, I recommend reading the work of [John Fritze at _CNN_](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/john-fritze), [Chris Geidner's _Law Dork_](https://www.lawdork.com), and the [SCOTUS team at _Slate_](https://slate.com/tag/supreme-court).\n\nI'm not as worked up about this one because it doesn't involve direct or indirect financial incentives, or a spouse inserting themselves, however superfluously, into schemes resembling a coup. And it shouldn't change the assumptions of anyone who has been paying attention to Alito for the past many years. Yes, it's infuriating and concerning and beyond anything I would hope for our highest court. But it's not a surprise.\n\nOf course, I don't believe he didn't know about the flag hanging _outside his house_, or its meaning as a sign of solidarity with \"stop the steal\" whackos, and of course, blaming your spouse in the national press is... a choice, and of course \"my neighbors were teasing me first\" isn't an appropriate reaction for a Supreme Court justice to the political speech of his neighbors, however performative and counterproductive that speech may be. \n\nBut the handwringing over this flag episode is based on the idea that anyone paying attention could take seriously the proposition that Alito lacks bias or could possibly be impartial in cases related to the election and the Capitol riot, or really any issue of importance to, eh, people of his political ilk. Impartial people, and people worried about at least appearing impartial, do not [give the keynote speech](https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/11/at-federalist-society-convention-alito-says-religious-liberty-gun-ownership-are-under-attack/) at Federalist Society conventions. \n\n(Nor do they [inveigh wholeheartedly against a Constitution protective of the rights of all Americans](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/05/supreme-court-south-carolina-redistricting-ruling-clarence-thomas-brown-v-board.html), but that is beyond the scope of this post‚Ä¶)\n\nUsually, this is where I would admit my own outsize portion of cynicism, and caution Dear Readers to consider this screed in that light, but this time I do the opposite: the fact is, the suggestion that Alito has any impartiality to preserve is, at this point, blatantly dishonest or an inadvertent admission of na√Øvet√©.

It can be that, it‚Äôs happening again.\n\nThis immediately struck me as a perfect description of what I like about [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) and [Omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol). Each is made by a [person](https://adam.omg.lol/) or a [small team](https://micro.blog/about) who are constantly involved in the community, who we can report bugs to, suggest features to, or just chat with, and who greet criticism head-on with clear explanations of why they hold their positions, and who maintain a willingness to change their minds. \n\nI'm not saying they're perfect -- after all, like you and I, they're _people_, so of course they're not perfect. But that's just it: they're _people_, and they treat their users like they're people, too.\n\nWe get all of this because we pay a really, _really_ reasonable fee to join these communities, relieving them of the need to pursue increasingly questionable methods of revenue generation.\n\nThat's the web worth paying for, and I'm happy to be here.\n",

The writing, direction, acting and SOUND DESIGN are as good as the first and in some areas even better.¬†</p><p>The main flaw that bugged me was SPOILER ALERT:</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>The day one flashback was really only there to remind us who JK was on the first one and introduce us to Cillian and his kid. One or two more flashbacks throughout the story may have balanced it a bit. I wouldn‚Äôt want anything predictable like showing one of Emmit‚Äôs family members dying, I actually think not seeing that stuff puts us in his mindset: it‚Äôs hard for him to think about but it‚Äôs all he thinks about.¬†</p><p>I thought the conclusion was perfect, with the children both growing into their dad‚Äôs shoes, although it‚Äôs worth nothing that mom is consistently as badass and brave as dad. But when you lose someone you love you often want to live up to them somehow because it feels like they‚Äôre still there with you when you embody their best qualities. So I get it.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "Some notable passages from today's 3rd Circuit opinion in <em>Fields v. City of Philadelphia</em>,¬†holding that there is a First Amendment right to record police officers in public, written by Circuit Judge <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_L._Ambro\">Thomas L. Ambro</a>:\n\n<blockquote>the District Court focused on whether Plaintiffs had an expressive intent, such as a desire to disseminate the recordings, or to use them to criticize the police, at the moment when they recorded or attempted to record police activity. [...] This reasoning ignores that the value of the recordings may not be immediately obvious, and only after review of them does their worth become apparent. The First Amendment protects actual photos, videos, and recordings, see <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=564+U.S.+786&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,31&amp;case=12960598670321445636&amp;scilh=0\">Brown v. Entm‚Äôt Merchants Ass‚Äôn, 564 U.S. 786, 790 (2011)</a>, and for this protection to have meaning the Amendment must also protect the act of creating that material.</blockquote>\n\nand\n\n<blockquote>To record what there is the right for the eye to see or the ear to hear corroborates or lays aside subjective impressions for objective facts. Hence to record is to see and hear more accurately. Recordings also facilitate discussion because of the ease in which they can be widely distributed via different forms of media. Accordingly, recording police activity in public falls squarely within the First Amendment right of access to information. As no doubt the press has this right, so does the public.</blockquote>\n\nbut\n\n<blockquote>We do not say that all recording is protected or desirable. The right to record police is not absolute. ‚Äú[I]t is subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.‚Äù <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=622+F.3d+248&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,31&amp;case=16745214870858628586&amp;scilh=0\">Kelly, 622 F.3d at 262</a>; see <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=193+F.3d+177&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,31&amp;case=7674457757070078920&amp;scilh=0\">Whiteland Woods, L.P. v. Twp. of W. Whiteland, 193 F.3d 177, 183 (3d Cir. 1999)</a>. But in public places these restrictions are restrained.</blockquote>\n\nand\n\n<blockquote>Having decided the existence of this First Amendment right, we now turn to whether the officers are entitled to qualified immunity. We conclude they are.</blockquote>\n\nThat last bit is primarily, though not solely, because the 3rd Circuit had not decided such a case as this yet when the incidents in question occurred. Now that the existence of the right to record police in public is \"clearly established,\" the next time a similar case shows up in court, qualified immunity may be off the table.

Naranjo OK‚Äôd it for viewing by the jury.\n  \n  But Bobby Newman, the attorney for Kelly Jones guiding the court through the Infowars clips, was laying the groundwork for the argument that there is no separation between Alex Jones, father, and Alex Jones, Infowarrior.\n</blockquote>\n\nIt's a solid argument, and Alex Jones is in a bit of a bind here, forced to choose between maintaining the authenticity of a lunatic his inexplicably massive fanbase worships and sacrificing that authenticity in an attempt to hang onto custody of his young children.\n",

With this requirement, Maryland effectively aids religions that profess a belief in God at the expense of any other form of belief or disbelief. The First Amendment expressly prohibits a state from taking this position. Although the candidate has the option of not pursuing public office rather than declaring a belief in God, the test is an unconstitutional encroachment on the freedom of religion.\n</blockquote>\n\nSo these laws aren't enforceable, but the fact that they're still on the books is an affront to the Constitution and should embarrass any lawmaker who claims to respect that Constitution.\n",

Another is to fail to refer workers to doctors for proper tests and diagnoses. Each time an injury causes an employee to miss a day of work or to receive medical treatment beyond first aid, the company is required to record it in an OSHA log book. This data is reported each year to the Department of Labor and is used to identify industries with high injury rates‚Äîwhose facilities will then face increased inspections. An industry that reports low injury rates is less likely to receive scrutiny from OSHA‚Äôs overstretched investigators.\n</blockquote>\n\nIf employers can self-report why can't employees?\n\nThe argument against employee reports would be:\n\n<blockquote>\n  Well, employees will inflate injury rates!\n</blockquote>\n\nLet's think about this: employers are already fraudulently <em>minimizing</em> the rates.

In thinking about the ways in which reproductive justice calls for us to respect the right to have a child, not have a child, or parent that child in a safe and healthy environment, the upshot for me is that the reproductive justice paradigm does not demand that outsider families conform to some particular form in order to help dismantle hierarchy.\n</blockquote>\n\nI have thought about this concern since undergrad, where postcolonial literature, feminism and even semiotics courses touched on the nature of othering as an active verb, something done to a group of people.

With it, I can go from a 40th percentile job description to a 90th percentile one in just a few minutes, all thanks to a beautifully presented machine learning algorithm.\n</blockquote>\n\nI respect Human Resources professionals. Their job can be shitty. But so can their job descriptions. The prospects who know what you mean by \"incumbent\" are probably too pedantic and detail-oriented to apply to the likely underpaid and/or intellectually vapid position you're hiring for. The ones who <em>don't</em> know what you mean don't actually know what they're applying to, which makes them terrible prospects.\n\nIf machine learning can remedy that, I hope it gains wider use. But I don't think machine learning is necessary to stop writing the kind of drivel that passes for a job description these days. It's a classic failure of capitalism: when demand dramatically outstrips supply, quality decreases without consequences to the supplier. This goes for jobs, treatment by employers, and even job descriptions. They were never exactly the pinnacle of eloquence, but I've seen a serious decline in the past year or so.\n\nMany legal filings written by attorneys are also full of reader-hostile jargon and nonsense clearly included because the lawyer's writing professor said it should be included, or because the named partner at their first firm always used it. It's one of the most infuriating and offensive aspects of modern U.S. professional culture as far I'm concerned:\n\n\"We do it this way because we do it this way, because the people before us did it this way, that's why we do it this way.\"\n\nNever, <em>ever</em> say that to me. It triggers an almost instinctual, lizard-brain contempt in me and an assumption that whoever said it is incapable of critical thinking or analytical reasoning, and I can be a real asshole when I think that about someone.\n",

Our data, battery life, time, and privacy are taken by a blank check with no recourse. It‚Äôs like ordering from a restaurant menu with no prices, then being forced to pay whatever the restaurant demands at the end of the meal.\n</blockquote>\n\nI was one of <em>many</em> purchasers who paid $2.99 to try out Peace on my iPhone, helping to send it flying to the top of the paid app charts almost immediately.

With the currently limited flexibility of the user experience, we both felt it best not to continue to sell or support the app.  Ghostery is based on giving the consumer the choice as to what they block and when. Ghostery doesn‚Äôt block ads or any other content by default. That‚Äôs too subjective a call.  If there are objective measures for what types of tracking should be blocked, then that‚Äôs an option we‚Äôll pursue. Right now, however, we didn‚Äôt feel that we had the mix right in Peace.

The photo had the name ‚ÄúMAXWELL‚Äù across the top and the young man was identified by Sgt. Johnston as Maxwell Morton.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The inapplicability of words like ‚Äúephemeral‚Äù and ‚Äúprivate‚Äù to Snapchat is <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/10/technology/mobile/snapchat-not-private/\" target=\"_blank\">well-documented</a>. But it‚Äôs not common knowledge, and this suspect‚Äôs use of the app to send photos of the deceased victim, including one of the suspect <em>posing</em> with the decedent, illustrates the consequences of that ignorance.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting side effect of the prevalence of photo sharing apps incorrectly seen as ephemeral or private is the preservation of a photographic record of the crime or its aftermath. It‚Äôs safe to say that the selfie in question would damage the defense‚Äôs case if introduced at trial. This case involved a third-party recipient of the photos, whose mother volunteered the photos to the police, negating the need to obtain a warrant.</p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs a strange reversal of the Big Brother scenario when defendants preserve and disseminate evidence connecting them to crime. Prosecutors and defense attorneys alike should keep well-informed about popular messaging apps of all kinds. The availability, and perhaps questionable admissibility, of documentary evidence generated by smartphones is not something attorneys can ignore in good faith.</p>\n</div>\n",

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act‚Äîa 1998 copyright law designed to prevent digital piracy‚Äîclassifies breaking a technological protection measure over a device‚Äôs programming as a breach of copyright.

One of the primary legal issues raised by the vote is substantially similar in the U.K. and the U.S.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mitochondrial transfer passes on genetic changes from one generation to another. That raises ethical concerns because any unexpected problems caused by <em>the procedure could affect people who are not yet born, and so cannot give their consent to have the treatment</em>. Mitochondria are not completely understood, and the DNA they hold might affect people‚Äôs traits in unknown ways. For that reason, some scientists believe mitochondria should be better understood before the procedures are legalised.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(emphasis added)</p>\n\n<p>The House of Lords takes up the bill later this month and, if they pass it, it will become law in the United Kingdom. U.S. law considers medical treatment without the patient‚Äôs consent battery, and the offender can face both criminal and civil liability. Similar liability exists under U.K. law, as well.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is complex because in a way it is the opposite of abortion: medical intervention meant to prevent potentially life-threatening conditions. The patient, in this case the unborn child, will, assuming the procedure is effective to the extent it prevents life-threatening conditions, survive to assert his or her victimhood in the event of adverse consequences.</p>\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt know the answer here, but I will be watching this story and I‚Äôll write about any updates as they happen.</p>\n</div>\n",

This method would be problematic from a funding perspective, and may cause diplomatic friction.\n\nAlternatively, the CFA could be amended to allow ‚Äúproportional responses‚Äù by private U.S. companies to foreign-based hacking. This method would be problematic from oversight and transparency perspectives, subjecting revenge hacking to market dynamics and the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù in which companies conduct so much of their business (especially when they‚Äôre privately held).\n\nYes, companies often have to deal with reporting requirements in the aftermath of a major data breach, but they don‚Äôt have to disclose any countermeasures under any current state or federal notification regime I can find.\n\nPerhaps the best solution would involve some hybrid of these. For example, a department of government investigators and hackers could be assigned in small groups to companies facing imminent or ongoing foreign-based hacking.\n\nThey could embed into the companies like journalists sometimes embed into military units, assisting the company in its response and pulling the trigger on revenge hacks, insulating the company from CFA immunity.\n\nThe hybrid method minimizes government expense, maximizes company involvement and allows for the use of transparency laws such as the Freedom of Information Act by journalists and policy analysts to peek inside the black box.\n\nI‚Äôm obviously not going to come up with a perfect solution in a short blog post, but it‚Äôs worth thinking about.\n\n<em>Image by the author</em>\n",

According to a DOJ press release:\n\n<blockquote>\n  Attorney General Holder announced today that the Department of Justice will take the position in litigation that the protection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 extends to claims of discrimination based on an individual‚Äôs gender identity, including transgender status. Attorney General Holder informed all Department of Justice component heads and United States Attorneys in a memo that the department will no longer assert that Title VII‚Äôs prohibition against discrimination based on sex excludes discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender discrimination, reversing a previous Department of Justice position. Title VII makes it unlawful for employers to discriminate in the employment of an individual ‚Äúbecause of such individual‚Äôs‚Ä¶sex,‚Äù among other protected characteristics.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/12/18/doj-transgender-people-cant-be-discriminated-against-at-work/\" target=\"_blank\">reported the story</a>, saying:\n\n<blockquote>\n  According to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, a survey of 6,450 transgender people in the United States, transgender people experience twice the rate of unemployment as other Americans and are much more likely to live in poverty. Advocates attribute those facts in part to the difficulty transgender people face in finding a job.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Direct antidiscrimination legislation addressing the prejudice so many LGBTQ people face would be much better than the DOJ‚Äôs reinterpretation of <a href=\"http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>.

Lexis uses some proprietary search syntax, which I learned in law school but despise having to use.</p>\n\n<p>If you have access to <a href=\"http://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/lexis-advance.page\" target=\"_blank\">Lexis Advance</a> or <a href=\"http://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/westlaw-legal-research\" target=\"_blank\">Westlaw Next</a>, those products bring simpler search syntax to the paid-research world. But if not, use Google Scholar to get a good sense of the landscape and then head to a paid service to make sure the law is still good, and to follow research leads that may not present themselves in Google Scholar.</p>\n</div>\n",

This time, it‚Äôs not that technology plays or should play a particular part in the case itself, but that a podcast has shed light on a cold case that may lead to an unexpected outcome.</p>\n\n<p>The podcast‚Äôs producers interviewed Deirdre Enright, director of the University of Virginia School of Law‚Äôs <a href=\"http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/academics/practical/innocenceclinic.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Innocence Project</a> for <a href=\"http://serialpodcast.org/season-one/7/the-opposite-of-the-prosecution\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 7</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Lindsay Beyerstein reports at the <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The UVA Innocence Project is poised to ask a court to test an old physical evidence recovery kit (PERK) that was used on Lee‚Äôs body to test for possible sexual assault in 1999 but was never tested for DNA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The DNA is an issue that might never have come up but for the Serial producers‚Äô interview with Professor Enright. It‚Äôs the first instance I‚Äôve heard of where a podcast may directly affect the outcome of a legal case. And considering the defendant, Syed, has already been sentenced to life in prison, any change at all to his sentence, let alone total exoneration, would be unexpected and important.</p>\n\n<p>It implicates a power to uncover truth in cold cases heretofore reserved primarily to outfits like Professor Enright‚Äôs. What‚Äôs even more compelling to me is that Serial mixes the modern technology of podcasting with the very old style of serial storytelling. The whole thing exposes how, increasingly, the law benefits from ancillary developments in journalism and technology. It‚Äôll be fascinating to hear the ultimate outcome when we get there.</p>\n</div>\n",

An employee noticed suspicious file names while working on the laptop, and notified police. Police arrived at the store and asked the employee to access the files to ascertain whether or not they were actually child pornography. An employee attached Defendant‚Äôs hard drive to a Best Buy computer and confirmed the presence of child pornography on the drive.</p>\n\n<p>The failure to obtain a search warrant prior to accessing the files was ultimately fatal to the charges brought against Defendant. The warrantless search was held to violate his Fourth Amendment right to freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. Specifically, the court held ‚Äúphysically attaching another device to its hard drive‚Äù was a trespass amounting to an unlawful search under the Fourth Amendment and a similar provision of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>None of the possible <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Exceptions_to_the_warrant_requirement\" target=\"_blank\">exceptions</a> to the warrant requirement were present, so the evidence was suppressed under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusionary_rule\" target=\"_blank\">exclusionary rule</a>.

Their rush to obtain evidence allowed a possessor of child pornography to avoid the legal consequences of his crime.</p>\n\n<p>I know law enforcement is a difficult job, and it‚Äôs often easier to blog about something after the fact than to make the perfect decision in the field every single time. But hopefully this case resulted in a comprehensive seminar on Fourth Amendment compliance in evidence gathering for the police department involved.</p>\n\n<p>And hopefully the Defendant will be caught again, and when he is, the evidence will be lawfully gathered and the jail sentence very, very long.</p>\n</div>\n",

While the tech can be a blunt instrument in a world of nuance (some borrowers are doing their best, others are surely not), I don‚Äôt oppose it. Assuming everyone was aware of the terms of the loan, it‚Äôs a valid contract, etc.</p>\n\n<p>But this sentence gave me pause:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\n  Using the GPS technology on the devices, the lenders can also track the cars‚Äô location and movements.\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, there probably isn‚Äôt anything illegal about it, assuming a valid contract.

After all, if you need to use a GPS device to manage risk, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be making the loan in the first place. Borrowers using subprime auto loans probably just can‚Äôt afford to get a car.</p>\n\n<p>Some drivers volunteer for activity-tracking devices as a way of <a href=\"http://ift.tt/1efPpJW\" target=\"_blank\">qualifying for reduced car insurance premiums</a>. Such people can already afford insurance though, and allow their provider to track their behavior as an added savings.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it‚Äôs less the tech involved and more the word ‚Äúsubprime,‚Äù which to me invariably suggests a corporation taking advantage of someone who can‚Äôt actually afford what they‚Äôre getting, and will inevitably default.</p>\n</div>\n",

Instagram users like Nikki steal images of babies and children off the Internet, give them a new name, and claim them as their own. Sometimes they create entire fake families.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The sad thing is there is relatively little protection to be had from the law in situations like this. You may be able to sue someone using your likeness in a commercial venture without your permission, but non-commercial use of the nature described above is rarely protected in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Instagram users should review their privacy settings by reading the company‚Äôs help pages about <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/116024195217477/\" target=\"_blank\">controlling your visibility</a> and setting photos and video as <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/448523408565555\" target=\"_blank\">viewable only to approved followers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Keep this in mind, though: even if you set your content as private, sharing a link to a photo or video on a social network like Twitter or Facebook will allow <em>anyone with that link</em> to view it.</p>\n\n<p>People who do steal your photos and pretend they‚Äôre your child or your child‚Äôs parent are violating Instagram‚Äôs <a href=\"http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>, which prohibits impersonation, among other things (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You must not defame, stalk, bully, abuse, harass, threaten, <strong>impersonate</strong> or intimidate people or entities [‚Ä¶]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>Fast Company</em> article to which I link above includes a statement from Instagram that the company does remove the stolen images when users report such activity.</p>\n\n<p>This story is another lesson to be mindful of not only what you share online, but how you share it. After all, a private company like Instagram could simply choose to ignore concerns like these, and users would have no recourse. Social networks can be a rich and vibrant way to stay in touch, but we are all responsible for what and how we share.</p>\n</div>\n",

Formerly bullet-proof business models no longer guarantee the luxurious profits to which so many law firms were once accustomed. And law firm leadership, like publishing and music executives before them, must find innovative ways to provide new value to clients and industry peers.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs why law firms like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Winston and Strawn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are doing more ancillary legal work in-house. I wonder whether more firms will pitch those services to their competitors. It sounds counterintuitive to provide valuable services to competitors, but I think there‚Äôs a case to be made for it as a way to revitalize the legal industry.</p>\n<p>Many law firms could use guidance on business process improvement, e-discovery, technology, management consulting and more. No one is more qualified to provide those service to law firms than other law firms. Two factors should minimize the fear of deliberate sabotage by a firm you have hired in a non-legal consulting role. The first is a reputational consideration and the second is an ethical one.</p>\n<p>Law firms providing their own third-party services to clients and non-clients, including other law firms, have the opportunity every business has when it is among the first to market with an innovative high-value product or service. That opportunity is the chance to become the gold standard, to set the bar high and be the first name that comes up when someone seeks out that product or service. It makes good business sense to treat that first-mover reputational advantage as you would any valuable asset, with great care and cultivation.</p>\n<p>&lt;</p>\n<p>p&gt;Law firms, via the attorneys who helm and staff them, are subject to myriad ethical requirements. The same processes currently in place at most large law firms to manage conflicts of interest, particularly with regard to walling off potentially conflicted attorneys from a given client or matter, could be easily applied to the firms consulting clients. In fact, the team within a firm which provides third-party consulting services to other firms could be completely walled off from the firms legal work, insulating the consulting services from concerns about endangering relationships with and the interests of current, former and prospective clients.</p>\n",

Ben Thompson wrote an <a href=\"http://stratechery.com/2010/apple-innovators-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\">exhaustive case study</a> of Apple‚Äôs own self-disruption that perfectly illustrates the strategy.\n\nMany firms are still trying to cope with the boom in third-party legal services providers and complaints about the cost of good legal representation. Formerly bullet-proof business models no longer guarantee the luxurious profits to which so many law firms were once accustomed. And law firm leadership, like publishing and music executives before them, must find innovative ways to provide new value to clients and industry peers.\n\nThat‚Äôs why law firms like <a href=\"http://www.winston.com/en/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Winston and Strawn</a> are doing more ancillary legal work in-house. I wonder whether more firms will pitch those services to their competitors. It sounds counterintuitive to provide valuable services to competitors, but I think there‚Äôs a case to be made for it as a way to revitalize the legal industry.\n\nMany law firms could use guidance on business process improvement, e-discovery, technology, management consulting and more. No one is more qualified to provide those service to law firms than other law firms. Two factors should minimize the fear of deliberate sabotage by a firm you have hired in a non-legal consulting role. The first is a reputational consideration and the second is an ethical one.\n\nLaw firms providing their own third-party services to clients and non-clients, including other law firms, have the opportunity every business has when it is among the first to market with an innovative high-value product or service. That opportunity is the chance to become the gold standard, to set the bar high and be the first name that comes up when someone seeks out that product or service. It makes good business sense to treat that first-mover reputational advantage as you would any valuable asset, with great care and cultivation.\n\n&lt;\n\np&gt;Law firms, via the attorneys who helm and staff them, are subject to myriad ethical requirements. The same processes currently in place at most large law firms to manage conflicts of interest, particularly with regard to walling off potentially conflicted attorneys from a given client or matter, could be easily applied to the firms consulting clients. In fact, the team within a firm which provides third-party consulting services to other firms could be completely walled off from the firms legal work, insulating the consulting services from concerns about endangering relationships with and the interests of current, former and prospective clients.\n",

The first is that the most recent episode (embedded below), entitled <a href=\"http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-law/265\" target=\"_blank\">Monkeys, Ducks and Unicorns</a>, discusses the Aereo case as well as a recent Fourth Amendment case about cell phones, both decided by the Supreme Court in June.</p>\n\n<p>The second reason I‚Äôm featuring This Week in Law is because I have probably listened to more hours of this podcast than any other. It got me through law school by educating, entertaining and inspiring me, even while I was studying far less interesting areas of the law.

But on second thought, it would behoove AT&amp;T to stick to it‚Äôs ‚Äúvow,‚Äù if for no other reason than to grease the skids for regulatory approval of the deal. Like I <a href=\"/post/84847936626/moves-contradicting-previous-statement-may-share-user\" target=\"_blank\">said about Moves and Facebook</a>, it‚Äôs hard to blame a company for seeking growth.</p>\n\n<p>While the FCC‚Äôs Open Internet rules have been struck down since they were first imposed in 2010, Comcast still abides by those rules pursuant to requirements <a href=\"http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/nbcuniversal-transaction\" target=\"_blank\">imposed by the FCC</a> on its purchase of NBCUniversal.</p>\n\n<p>Now that those rules have been struck down, and we‚Äôre in limbo while a new rules proposal <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/15/5720730/how-to-comment-on-fcc-net-neutrality-proposal\" target=\"_blank\">goes through its comment period</a>, AT&amp;T committing to the Comcast restrictions presumes the FCC will have similar concerns about their purchase of DirecTV. So the worst case scenario for AT&amp;T is that the FCC achieves similar restrictions via the new rules, in which case AT&amp;T is already prepared. And the best case scenario is that the new rules are more lenient than the 2010 rules, and AT&amp;T is even happier.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the only losers here are consumers. While there is some question about whether this consolidation in the connectivity/content space will cause <em>immediate</em> market overlap and thus a significant reduction in local competition, it‚Äôs hard to see how things will get better for consumers as a result of this vertical integration over time.</p>\n</div>\n",

Facebook has a growing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook\" target=\"_blank\">list of acquisitions</a> under its belt, so that concern is likely to increase with time.\n\nThis example of corporate self-contradiction is a good reminder: Always assume your data is a valuable and transferable commodity in the eyes and on the servers of the apps and services you use. Some people are deterred by that fact, while others are not. There is no right or wrong answer, just a continuum of personal comfort and preference.\n\nWhile I wish the companies had been more forthright from the beginning, I won‚Äôt stop using Moves. I have personally always been relatively open in sharing data in exchange for convenience and utility. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not alarmed by the increasing difficulty of using the internet and related apps and services for those who disagree with my position on openness.\n\n&lt;\n\np&gt;Share your perspective via email at joe@joeross.me, on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/joeross\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> or in the comments.\n",

When I got there it was at first quite shocking because I was now twenty-two and hadn‚Äôt been there since the age of eight. Nothing had really changed, but I felt that I wasn‚Äôt really looking at the village, but I was experiencing it as if I were reading it.

If I did not cite the brief, though, then that would (or could) be plagiarism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It would be an interesting bit of research to determine how many sentences are copied without attribution from the briefs of other attorneys. I suspect it happens often.</p>\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs uncreative to cite another lawyer‚Äôs brief. Legal writing is a game of cites. If anything, an uncited thought may raise questions rather than project creativity.</p>\n\n<p>The real creativity in legal advocacy, as far as I have learned in law school, working as a litigation paralegal and reading far too much legal writing for ‚Äúpleasure,‚Äù is in the optimal juxtaposition, <em>creatively</em>, of the cited facts and the thoughts of your forbears.</p>\n\n<p>No one wants to see a newly minted physics professor work out the proof for E = MC2. The formula is there as a shortcut so others can build, creatively, upon the concepts for which it provides a shorthand.</p>\n\n<p>After all, what judge prefers your lengthy version of an angle you could just as easily refer to with a short quote and a cite to a previous brief?</p>\n\n<p>Whatever you think of this, a quick search turned up a bit of further reading on the issue and I‚Äôve included a few links below.

If you don‚Äôt believe it can really be that bad, <a href=\"http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2013_14/measures/documents/hb2453_01_0000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">read the PDF</a>.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>It is that bad. Ignorance is one thing, but open hostility like this cannot stand and anyone who supports this bill commits the intellectual equivalent of burning the original Constitution to a pile of ashes.</p>\n\n<p>Let me translate that from fiery liberal anger into constitutional principles:</p>\n\n<p>A law allowing the detrimental differential treatment of a class of persons traditionally subject to invidious discrimination because they belong to that class violates the Equal Protection rights granted by the Constitution as to the federal government in the 5th Amendment and extended as to the States by the 14th Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>Let us quote <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv\" target=\"_blank\">the Good Document itself</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gotta love that 14th Amendment. There‚Äôs nothing ambiguous in the juxtaposition of the Kansas bill and the Constitution. You can‚Äôt deny someone equal protection of the laws. You can‚Äôt tell me I‚Äôm not allowed in your hotel because I‚Äôm a man. Maybe if it‚Äôs a country club. But not a hotel. Or a restaurant. Or a state.</p>\n\n<p>The use of freedom of religion as a pathetic attempt to hide animosity and hatred is a supreme act of collective cowardice by the Kansan legislators who vote for this bill.</p>\n\n<p>It is an un-American as it gets. But the good news is, as one ruling after another makes ever-more-clear, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/13/virginia-same-sex-marriage/5473687/\" target=\"_blank\">you can‚Äôt stop history</a>.</p>\n</div>\n",

Some children are suckered into this or bribed, others go willingly with a terrifyingly adult devotion to their cause.\n\nMy friend was patrolling with a sniper company one day, not long after  the two real bombs had gone off. The trigger man spotted a child approaching the underside of the bridge.\n\nThe sniper, following new orders the company had received in the wake of the two recently detonated IEDs, lined up a shot and took it, instantly killing the child.\n\nFurther invesigation revealed that the bag the child had been carrying was empty.\n\nThis tragic illustration of what has happened and may still happen in Iraq and Afghanistan is not the only story my friend had. There was the eight-year-old boy who approached a patrol of Iraqi army officers and US Marines, begging for water. He quickly triggered a bomb vest he had been wearing under his clothes and took the lives of five servicemen, as well as his own. There was the other young boy who drove a car bomb up to a local school, killing himself and a dozen other children.\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing part of the conversation I had with my friend about these stories was how he told them. We discussed the sad sickness of a war that involves children, but he made clear, in the field, second-guesses are dangerous luxuries.\n\nWe can only wonder, from this side of war, what these situations are doing to men and women who fight them for us. The statistics are daunting, but this is not that kind of article. Making men and women into numbers is part of the problem.\n\nLet‚Äôs try to keep in mind, not only on Memorial or Veterans days, what exactly it means to serve your country, and that sometimes, even if someone returns physically unharmed, they may not have survived unscathed.\n\nThey do not confine their service to one or two days a year, and we must not so limit our gratitude. It is a debt we cannot repay, but we must never stop trying.\n\n<em>Image courtesy an anonymous friend of the author, with permission.</em>\n",

(The project is open source, online at GitHub). Tax and immigration law lend themselves to this approach more easily than some other areas, but in many instances, he says, law can be turned into a mathematical function: If this, then that; if these, then that or those.</blockquote>\nThis is a great idea, and one I‚Äôll definitely keep an eye on. Very cool.\n\n</div>\n",

I‚Äôve used all of Tumblr‚Äôs competitors extensively and I settled on Tumblr because it‚Äôs mindfully-designed, community-focused, and dead simple. The lack of ads helped, but more important to me than services with no ads are services that do have ads at least respecting their users enough to have decent ads.</p>\n<p>So.</p>\n<p>Keep ads for The Bachelorette out of my dashboard feed. Please consider presenting users with relevant ads. Scan my blog, the tags i use, the words I like, the stuff I link to. After all, you own it. So look at it. Run it through an algorithm and spit out some sort of value which you can key to a set of sponsored posts that, based on their weighted relevance to my interests and the things I cover on my blog, may actually be interesting to me. This is more palatable to users and more valuable to advertisers than showing me some random woman running around on the beach.</p>\n<p>Over and over again.</p>\n<p>Despite my never clicking it or reblogging it or seeing it without making an angry face and swearing never to watch that goddamn show. This dashboard spam does not bode well for Tumblr‚Äôs future at Yahoo, and that makes me sad, because I like Tumblr, and I rather like both of your styles, to the extent I can know anything about them from reading things on the Internet or watching you do interviews.</p>\n<p>You said you wouldn‚Äôt fuck this up, but the glut of sponsored posts in my feed tonight about something I‚Äôve never given any corner of the web any reason to think I care about suggests otherwise. Turn it around while you still can.</p>\n<p>Change Yahoo, change Tumblr a bit if you must, but why not change advertising and the typically adversarial relationship between advertisers and target audiences while you‚Äôre at it?</p>\n<p>in other words, don‚Äôt shove bad ads in our faces. If we wanted that we would turn on the TV or some other medium that can only collect data in really clumsy inaccurate old ways.</p>\n<p>You‚Äôve disrupted plenty of things, why not this?</p>\n<p>If you ever want more advice, get in touch.

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if pricing flucutated from year to year based on what revenue each hospital brings in. That‚Äôs unconscionable, and a failure of the free market in arguably the most important industry. Hospitals and <a style=\"text-decoration:none\" href=\"http://your-pharmacies.com\"><span style=\"color: #333333\">canadian pharmacies</span></a> would do well to get together and establish transparent and ethical best practices for pricing, because the alternative is onerous regluation to ensure they are not gouging insurance companies, government agencies, and individual patients without regard to actual costs.</p>\n</div>\n",

Meanwhile they‚Äôre backdooring this VoIP technology that lets you call people using only wifi.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook is asserting its primacy in the minds of millions of mobile users not only to dominate Android, but to put itself in a solid position to dominate carriers as well. Simple, user-friendly VoIP: one of the biggest and potentially most profound opportunities Google ever missed with Android.</p>\n</div>\n",

The department assigned an investigator, whose investigation consisted primarily of an offsite interview with Gosnell. The investigator never inspected the facility, questioned other employees, or reviewed any records. Department attorneys chose to accept this incomplete investigation, and dismissed the complaint as unconfirmed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Truly horrifying.</p>\n\n<p>While it‚Äôs a loaded topic that deserves more space than I have time these days to give it, suffice it to say that I am against any outright ban on abortion. Note that I placed the word abortion in quotes because the late-term procedures Gosnell did were not what legally can be considered abotions under any current law or jurisprudence: they were murders.</p>\n</div>\n",

IFTTT is truly amazing. One of its most useful functionalities is the ability to send an SMS to the service that triggers IFTTT to do something else. So, you can create a ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù that will forward all text messages in which you include a ‚Äú#t‚Äù to another internet service, like an email address. Email addresses are particularly handy because many other services use them, everything from Evernote to Tumblr assigns users an email address so you can send stuff into your account right from your email provider of choice.</p>\n\n<p>That way, an IFTTT recipe can receive a text message and, as long as ‚Äú#t‚Äù appears somewhere in the message (without the quotes), it will send an email to anyone I ask. Some services that let you add content via email assign unique email addresses that can receive email from anyone. They‚Äôre secure from spam because the email address is nonsense. Evernote does this.</p>\n\n<p>Others, however, use a universal email address and whitelist each user‚Äôs own email as the only one allowed to send stuff to that account. Task management services <a href=\"http://any.do\" target=\"_blank\">Any.do</a> and <a href=\"http://wunderlist.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wunderlist</a> both use this method, allowing registered users to send email to do@any.do and me@wunderlist.com, respectively. If the address you use to send the message is registered, the message subject is added to your account as a task, and the body is included as a note.</p>\n\n<p>Any.do is dedicated to creating the best task management experience on a mobile device, and they‚Äôre doing a great job. Wunderlist, while they have great mobile apps, is more focused on combining them with solid native desktop apps on all platforms. While I watch them add and refine features, I‚Äôm using them both.</p>\n\n<p>I know, I need to get a life.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/recipes/88932\" target=\"_blank\">this IFTTT recipe adds a task to Any.do via SMS</a>. And <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/recipes/88933\" target=\"_blank\">this IFTTT recipe adds a task to Wunderlist via SMS</a>. You should be able to edit the tag if you want, but I find ‚Äú#t‚Äù is conveniently short, and the recipe will remove it from the final task anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I have a couple more IFTTT recipes to share, so if you‚Äôre interested in this stuff, stay tuned.</p>\n",

I wanted to publish it here as well because I plan to write a follow-up soon, having graduated in January of this year. Many thanks to Philadelphia litigator Max Kennerly for his <a href=\"http://www.litigationandtrial.com/2009/04/articles/the-law/for-law-students/why-i-choose-temple-law-some-advice-for-an-incoming-law-student/\" target=\"_blank\">advice and kind words</a> about this post when it first ran. Also, <a href=\"http://phillygrrl.com/2009/06/25/if-youre-going-to-temple-law/\" target=\"_blank\">this post</a> by my Temple law classmate and friend Kishwer Vikaas Barrica was humbling, so thanks to her too!</em></p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<h2>In the Beginning‚Ä¶</h2>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs not a choice easily made. First of all, just the decision to take the <a href=\"http://www.lsac.org/\" target=\"_blank\">LSAT</a> is a journey in itself. It requires research, asking the right questions of the right people, preparing for failure and, perhaps most importantly, preparing for success.\nIt‚Äôs the success that can be most confusing. After all, if you do poorly on the test the first time, you resolve that you probably didn‚Äôt take it seriously enough, or that it was just a bad day. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúchoose your own adventure‚Äù feel to it. The first time I took the LSAT, my score was <em>embarrassing</em>. The only saving grace was that the average friend and family member has never had any reason to learn the how the test is scored, so they don‚Äôt know how poorly I did.</p>\n\n<p>I could have gotten off the train right there. I almost did. I almost decided that maybe it isn‚Äôt meant to be. But then I thought about it, and remembered that I don‚Äôt think <em>anything</em> is meant to be. That‚Äôs the great liberating foundation of my personal moral value system: freedom at the cost of accountability. Things happen to me because (a) I have made a decision that caused them or (b) someone else has made a decision that caused them. Thus, I can <em>decide</em> that I‚Äôm not cut out for lawyering, or I can decide that I am, and then act.</p>\n\n<p>So I took it again. And I did better. <em>Much</em> better. Suffice it to say that I am no longer embarrassed, even by my first score, because my second vindicated me. I studied harder, focused more deliberately, and made executive decisions about which questions I could answer well and which ones I could not.</p>\n\n<p>But getting a score you can respect yourself for is only the beginning.</p>\n\n<h2>Decisions, Decisions</h2>\n\n<p>Will you devote all of your time to your studies, subsidizing your living expenses as well as the cost of your education? Or will you retain your current employment, making the (in my opinion) far more daunting commitment to maintain your financial standing and continue to accrue work experience while you submit to the rigor of a legal education?</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, going to school full time looks like the most sensible decision. Everything you have heard about law school is true: it‚Äôs <em>hard</em>. It‚Äôs not an afterthought, or a hobby. It‚Äôs at <em>least</em> as mentally stressful as your job, and probably more. Like any graduate school, every hour of class time requires at least an hour outside the classroom. So, the ability to go to class all day and devote your evenings to study and work is a precious resource.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the economy is (still) bad, and even if previously borrowed loans are deferred while you are in graduate school, there are bills and rent to be paid, not to mention food and (dare I say) the occasional drink. Borrowing money for these expenditures is inadvisable at best. Working through law school is difficult, but, since the evening division is a part-time program, credit requirements are flexible: you must complete a certain amount, but you have summer sessions during which you can earn credit, as well. You can keep earning money, and producing promotable deliverables. But you‚Äôll be spending a few hours a night, a few nights a week, in a classroom. And that‚Äôs before you even start your homework. It may be a part-time education, but it‚Äôs a second full-time job.</p>\n\n<h2>So why did I choose Temple Law?</h2>\n\n<p>Well, even taking into account the (generous) aid package Drexel offered me, I would have had to borrow more money to cover living expenses than I‚Äôll likely need to borrow to go to Temple. Also, my 401(k) account makes me smile, and cutting it off for a few years would mean less smiles. Finally, I‚Äôve got a good thing going at my current job: good work, good people, good benefits. These are not things to be taken lightly in today‚Äôs job market. For every lawyer making $80k right out of school, there are three more at the unemployment office. And we‚Äôre talking <em>partners</em> here. People with <em>experience</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I made the commitment to work and go to school at the same time. I want to be confident about it, even arrogant. But the truth is that it‚Äôs terrifying. After all, I might not be able to do it. Then what? I don‚Äôt know. But I know that it‚Äôs what I want, and people do it every day. People with more stressful jobs, people with children. There are really no excuses.</p>\n\n<p>Classes are technically from 6pm to 10pm. I‚Äôm going to be in danger of succumbing to my burgeoning caffeine addiction. I‚Äôm going to be in danger of burning out. I‚Äôm going to be in danger of driving the girlfriend (more) insane (than usual).</p>\n\n<p>But maybe I‚Äôll quit caffeine and start meditating. Or running. Maybe I‚Äôll apply my work ethic to my studies, and develop a schedule that includes class time, study time, and mental stability time. Maybe I‚Äôll do well.</p>\n\n<h2>Closing Argument</h2>\n\n<p>This absurdly long post has served primarily as a ‚Äúthinking out loud‚Äù session for me, in which I‚Äôve tried to express what has been going on in my head as I near the next and most important part of my journey: actually going to law school. But this is the tip of the iceberg. This stuff takes me away mid-conversation at work, puts blank stares on my face while Meg‚Äôs talking to me, and keeps me wide awake in bed. It worries me, aggravates me, <em>scares me</em>. This is the stuff I always thought adults had to deal with, the stuff that I got to watch other people figure out while I wrote stories or played my guitar.</p>\n\n<p>Now I‚Äôm one of those people. I have a job, investments, credit cards, an actual (and good) credit score. I don‚Äôt think I could afford to work a side job and go to school. So it might take me longer to finish, while I take fewer classes. But my sense of financial security is young and, with the exception of some indinspensable help (for which I‚Äôll always be grateful), largely self-wrought. Risking it doesn‚Äôt seem right. So wish me luck.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm going to need it.</p>\n",

In other words, Aereo could provide its service with one antenna, but it needs to use one for every subscriber. The use of one antenna for <em>all</em> subscribers, as the Second Circuit held in its <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13763893657469687275&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\" target=\"_blank\">2008¬†<em>Cablevision</em> opinion</a>, would likely constitute an unlawful public performance.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Chin says in his dissent that he isn‚Äôt pleased by this technique:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Aereo‚Äôs ‚Äútechnology platform‚Äù is, however, a sham. The system employs thousands of individual dime-sized antennas, but there is no technologically sound reason to use a multitude of tiny individual antennas rather than one central antenna; indeed, the system is a Rube Goldberg-like contrivance, over-engineered in an attempt to avoid the reach of the Copyright Act and to take advantage of a perceived loophole in the law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Aereo‚Äôs technology isn‚Äôt an attempt to avoid the reach of the Act. It‚Äôs an attempt to comply with the Second Circuit‚Äôs own characterization of the Act‚Äôs meaning and purpose. The absurdity of the situation arises not from Aereo‚Äôs attempt at a ‚Äúsham,‚Äù but from the outdated Copyright Act itself.</p>\n\n<p>A quick glance at the rest of Judge Chen‚Äôs dissent suggests he may make some reasonable points distinguishing Aereo from the DVR service at issue in <em>Cablevision</em>, so I‚Äôll withhold my own final thoughts on this case until I‚Äôve read the Aereo opinion through.</p>\n\n<p>But copyright law needs fixing. It was written during a time when the cost of copying was non-trivial, and copies were typically finite and controlled centrally by the rightsholder. There is no longer any non-trivial cost to copying. Whether between servers or from a server to your computer, the internet is nothing more or less than a giant copy-making machine. This doesn‚Äôt mean we need to weaken copyright law (although shorter terms would be more in line with copyright‚Äôs <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause\" target=\"_blank\">Constitutional imperative</a>), but we do need to adapt it to the modern world.</p>\n\n<p>Professor David Post, whose copyright class I took at Temple Law, signed an <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/111298508/10-26-12-Brief-of-Amici-Curiae-in-Support-of-Aereo\" target=\"_blank\"><em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> in this case late last year‚Äîhere‚Äôs my <a href=\"http://joeross.me/post/34763954996/professor-david-post-copyright-is-meant-to-benefit-the\" target=\"_blank\">post about it</a>.</p>\n</div>\n",

As David Feith reports in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> piece linked to above:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The essence of China‚Äôs thinking about cyber warfare is the concept of shi, he says, first introduced in Sun Tzu‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Art of War‚Äù about 2,500 years ago.

Tao Hanzhang, who defines shi as ‚Äúthe strategically advantageous posture before a battle.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They‚Äôre not going to take down any infrastructure any time soon, but if and when they want to, their current efforts will probably go a long way to helping them learn how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>This stuff is not just a headline: it‚Äôs been happening for some time, is still happening, and is likely only to increase.

				"content_text": "<p>Evernote will be just fine, despite Google‚Äôs recent announcement of a new note-taking app called Google <a href=\"http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2013/03/google-keep-save-whats-on-your-mind.html\" target=\"_blank\">Keep</a>, currently available for the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/keep/\" target=\"_blank\">web</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>. Keep allows for text, audio, and images to be added to a single notebook and synced between the web and Android devices. You can even add stuff via <a href=\"http://www.google.com/landing/now/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Now</a>. It‚Äôs neat, but it‚Äôs no Evernote killer.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>The two products cater to very different use cases, and Keep will not be able to replace Evernote for its core customers. Evernote had <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/evernote-in-no-rush-to-make-users-pay-2012-11\" target=\"_blank\">1.5 million premium subscribers in November 2012</a>. At 45$/year, that‚Äôs around $67 million annually, and the number of subscribers has been rising for years.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn‚Äôt make them profitable, at least at the moment, but it helps. Coupled with Business accounts and other endeavors, Evernote isn‚Äôt worried. For those premium users, who pay because they make the most of Evernote‚Äôs vast feature set, Keep won‚Äôt be good enough. And I suspect that even if every user of Evernote‚Äôs free tier left the product, Evernote would hardly notice from an operational standpoint (if anything, operational costs would decrease).</p>\n\n<p>Instead, makers of task management apps should be concerned. <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Tasks</a> is as neglected as <a href=\"http://google.com/reader\" target=\"_blank\">Google Reader</a> was, and we all know <a href=\"http://joeross.me/post/45306123154/powering-down-google-reader\" target=\"_blank\">what happened to Reader</a>. Keep looks like an elegant upgrade to Google Tasks, and while Evernote has <a href=\"http://joeross.me/post/42849599646/evernote-ceo-hints-at-future-task-management\" target=\"_blank\">hinted at its own task management solution</a>, I don‚Äôt think the future of their business will depend on it.</p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs worth remembering: there just aren‚Äôt as many zero-sum games in the apps and services spaces as many, especially in the tech press, would have us believe. Design, feature set nuance, and adaptability to users‚Äô current workflow all allow for multiple apps to be successful in the same space. The Keep/Evernote dichotomy is no different.</p>\n\n<p><em>This article was adapted from a comment I left on <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/03/20/google-launches-evernote-rival-keep-for-the-web-android-4-0-and-above/#comment-837271966\" target=\"_blank\">The Next Web‚Äôs post about Keep</a></em>.</p>\n",

Now, my favorite Twitter app for Android, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jv.falcon.pro\" target=\"_blank\">Falcon Pro</a>, has hit Twitter‚Äôs artificial user limit.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>They have other apps, (like <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jv.falcon\" target=\"_blank\">an incredible widget that is also a fully-functional Twitter client</a>), but they can‚Äôt accept any more Falcon Pro users.</p>\n\n<p>Falcon Pro‚Äôs left- and right-drawer layout, with an elegant, clutter-free but feature-packed design, won me over instantly. It came out just as I had given up on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotsandlines.carbon\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon for Twitter</a>, a beautiful app nearly dismissed as vaporware as it  faced numerous release setbacks.</p>\n\n<p>Carbon finally came out, and it is very pretty, but Falcon Pro fits my personal Twitter use case best, so Carbon is a close second. You know what isn‚Äôt even in the top five? Twitter‚Äôs official Android client.</p>\n\n<p>Over 3,000 people have signed a petition to raise Falcon Pro‚Äôs limit as of Saturday night, but that‚Äôs at Twitter‚Äôs absolute discretion, and it would set a bad precedent, so I‚Äôm not holding my breath.</p>\n\n<p>But if you tried out Falcon Pro and didn‚Äôt like it, you can revoke the app‚Äôs access to your Twitter account, thereby freeing up a token for a new user.

Your developer community fosters a massive user base that may not otherwise come to or stay with Twitter, pumping data into your system for you to monetize. Developers get and keep users for you by offering designs, features, and improvements that you cannot provide. Don‚Äôt stifle that, celebrate it.</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<h4>Introduction</h4>\n\n<p>I hesitated to change themes because, well, it‚Äôs one of those things people do instead of writing. But while my customized version of <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/theme/9601\" target=\"_blank\">Quite Big</a> theme had treated me very well, I hate using Tumblr‚Äôs default mobile theme on phones, or seeing my desktop-optimized layout on a tablet. I also had modified Quite Big so much that it started to look a little off to me. I know enough HTML and CSS to avoid breaking sites altogether, but over time my changes had started to give the theme a clunky look. I decided that I needed to find the ultimate theme for me: minimal, useful, and responsive.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<h4>Minimal, Useful, and Responsive</h4>\n\n<p>Some people use minimal themes to keep the focus on their content. Others use minimal themes because they think any content placed within a minimal theme will <em>appear</em> great. I think of myself as the former, and it‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been personally trending to more minimal site designs for a long time. I consider the use of a minimal site design focused on content to be a commitment. It commits me to quality, and that‚Äôs a great thing.</p>\n\n<p>I also want my website‚Äôs design to be useful. I‚Äôm particularly annoyed when a theme requires me to scroll down to the footer to see how the author describes the site, what other pages are on it, or how you might contact the site‚Äôs purveyor. Give me the things I expect when and where I expect them. Yes, it is <em>absolutely</em> a sense of entitlement, but when you‚Äôre writing at a blog, you‚Äôre writing for whomever is reading. If most people expect things in a certain place, put them there and get to writing the real stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, most free blogging platforms have automatic mobile layouts, but they‚Äôre often global, meaning that all sites on the platform end up looking the same on a phone or whatever device the reader is using. This site is on Tumblr because I got tired of maintaining Wordpress and other self-managed CMS installations. I love Tumblr for its simplicity and its Markdown support, as well as its truly beautiful apps. But their ‚Äúoptimized mobile layout,‚Äù while minimal and designed for clarity, feels far too cookie-cutter.</p>\n\n<h4>Vision Quest</h4>\n\n<p>After all, a theme, however minimal, does more than determine post width and font face. It sets the tone for the site. It provides a context in which all of your content is going to be experienced. I think of site design, whether for a blog or a corporate portal, as a form of self-expression. Many people get enough self-expression out of being able to share whatever they want, or looking ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù or ‚Äúenterprise,‚Äù and to them the theme of their site isn‚Äôt important. But I take pride in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>having a vision for how my content should be presented to readers;</li>\n<li>seeking out well-made themes as starting points for that, and</li>\n<li>being able to make customizations that bring the theme I found and the vision I have together</li>\n</ul><p>If you can find a theme or site design that fits your vision out of the box, that‚Äôs great. Nothing beats just applying a new theme and getting to the writing part of it all. But if you do need to modify someone else‚Äôs design work, it‚Äôs important to leave credit somewhere in the theme.</p>\n\n<p><strike>I credit <a href=\"http://idrakimuhamad.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Idraki Muhamad</a>'s <a href=\"http://mnml-theme.tumblr.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">MNML</a> in the footer as well as on my <a href=\"/about\" target=\"_blank\">About</a> page. The changes I‚Äôve made fit the design into my vision, but Mr. Muhamad created the theme.</strike></p>\n\n<p><em>Ed. note: I‚Äôve moved to <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/theme/36900\" target=\"_blank\">Observer</a> by Tumblr designer Zach Sultan since first writing this in January, but the principals still apply, and MNML is an awesome theme.</em></p>\n\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n\n<p>Most people use blogs as a means to an end, usually to share opinions or showcase work. But geeks often see their blog as an end in itself. If your site is a book, its aesthetic and layout are the cover, and unlike many authors, bloggers have full control over it. I take advantage of that, and I encourage others to do the same.</p>\n\n<p>In a world of cloned ‚Äúdefault‚Äù themes, a site design with a little bit of personal nuance will stick in someone‚Äôs mind. You don‚Äôt need to use design to scream ‚ÄúI‚Äôm DIFFERENT!‚Äù but you should use it to politely remind visitors that, you know, you‚Äôre different.</p>\n\n<p>Then, all you have to do is write amazing content.</p>\n",

Similarly, no matter what privacy setting you use, sensitive and personal information ‚Äî photos, private journals, Facebook pages, corporate data, draft reports ‚Äî shared with third parties like Google and Facebook can be accessible by police without a judge‚Äôs approval.

				"content_text": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt know anything about design. I‚Äôm a user, and design work on websites made for frequent article consumption should be tailored to user experience. I may come off as arrogant, ignorant, or petty. That‚Äôs not my intention. I‚Äôm being honest about my thoughts.</em></p>\n\n<hr><p>Engadget has launched a full re-design, something we‚Äôve seen recently with sites like <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Next Web</em></a> and <a href=\"http://readwrite.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Read Write</em></a>. Like those, Engadget‚Äôs new look focuses on cross-platform responsiveness, with a bias for tablets. I don‚Äôt write about every redesign I see, but Engadget was the first blog I read with dedication, so it has a special place in my geek heart.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>Engadget‚Äôs previous design was, as even <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/20/dnp-welcome-to-the-new-and-improved-leaner-and-faster-engadget/\" target=\"_blank\">Editor-in-Chief Tim Stevens puts it</a>, ‚Äúheavy.‚Äù A better description would be clunky, crufty, and stale. I‚Äôm only going to mention a few details that are very important to me, instead of describing to you a website that you can just go see for yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TYPOGRAPHY</strong></p>\n\n<p>The new Engadget uses the free Google Web Font <a href=\"http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Oswald\" target=\"_blank\">Oswald</a> for headlines. It feels too narrow, but Engadget is prone to information-rich headlines, so I can understand why they chose it. Full-width article images get a headline overlay on top of the image. Opacity of the overlay increases to 1 when you hover your cursor over the headline text. I wish it went to 1 on hover over the image itself, making it easier to get that readable opaque background behind the article title.</p>\n\n<p>The body font is Georgia (same as this blog you‚Äôre reading now). It seems almost too pedestrian for a blog of Engadget‚Äôs means, as does the Google Web Font. After all, Engadget  has a budget and a design staff. I find it hard to believe that the best they could do font-wise was a free Google font and Georgia.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, <a href=\"http://theverge.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Verge</em></a> uses Helvetica or Arial, and <a href=\"http://readwrite.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Read Write</em></a> uses mere ‚Äúsans serif.‚Äù These blogs often cater to dedicated fan bases, so page loading speed is important: many readers click between multiple articles in one sitting.</p>\n\n<p>I wish font was larger in articles themselves. Yes, it‚Äôs easy to increase the size of the page with a quick CMD + (or CTRL + on Windows), but I definitely consider most of the web just a little small as far as font size. People should be able to sit back and read comfortably.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it‚Äôs just me (although I‚Äôm told my reading vision is fine), but if I have to lean forward to read a website, I‚Äôm having a bad reading experience. This is why I‚Äôm a frequent <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Daring Fireball</em></a> reader but I can‚Äôt remember the last time I visited the website itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MENUS AND UI</strong></p>\n\n<p>I like the topics bar at the top of the site and the placement of the search field immediately beneath it. Expand the ‚ÄúTopics‚Äù item on the far right of the top bar to reveal more specific categories. The spacing is touch target friendly, and I appreciate the lack of some fancy separator character.</p>\n\n<p>I like the banner at the top of the site. I like the loading bar that shows the time-to-change from one featured story to the next. I like the persistent table of contents on longer articles, like the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/20/dnp-welcome-to-the-new-and-improved-leaner-and-faster-engadget/\" target=\"_blank\">redesign announcement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Share buttons are well-placed on both the front page and article pages. Pinterest is an interesting addition to sharing options and one that I don‚Äôt see very often on sites of Engadget‚Äôs type. I occasionally dive into Pinterest myself to pepper my friends with gadget posts. Maybe Engadget can read my mind‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Probably not, though, otherwise the ‚ÄúVia‚Äù and ‚ÄúSource‚Äù links would be internalized instead of placed in article footers. I don‚Äôt go to Engadget because I think they break <em>every</em> tech news story ever, I go because their opinions on the news interest me. Thus, in-line source linking wouldn‚Äôt risk losing me to the source. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm the exception or the rule, but something about placing source links in the footer has always bugged me.</p>\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt like the sidebar with the headline-over-dimmed-image motif. It works in the main body of the site, but in the sidebar it‚Äôs cluttered and incredibly difficult to scan. I want to see ‚ÄúRecent Reviews‚Äù and other site content placed above links to the podcasts and other supplementary media. The ‚ÄúQuoted‚Äù section includes recent tweets from Engadget authors, but I think this space would be better used for pull-quotes from high-traffic or recent articles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\n\n<p>Engadget‚Äôs new design is an improvement over the old one, and they plan still more changes as they settle into the new look. Generally, I think their design direction and that of the big-name tech blogs as a whole is great. Tablet-optimized design built for fingertips instead of cursors leads to less clutter and more negative space. In case you haven‚Äôt noticed, that aesthetic tracks well with my own preferences, so it‚Äôs encouraging to me and hope it continues. I know these websites are businesses, but at the end of the day the reading experience is absolutely everything, and if things continue down this path, I expect to see even more improvements in the future.</p>\n",

(On Spotify, one LP is equivalent to 47,680 plays.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm a happy user of <a href=\"http://www.rdio.com\" target=\"_blank\">Rdio</a>, which is Spotify‚Äôs primary competitor. My fianc√©e and I pay $17.99 per month for Rdio‚Äôs unlimited streaming and downloading to our phones. At first glance, Mr. Krukowski‚Äôs article calls the morality of that set-up into question, particularly for someone who wishes he could make a living on <a href=\"http://joeross.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\">his own music</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some streaming subscribers probably buy more records than non-streamers as a result of discovering new musicians or getting so attached to a record that streaming it just isn‚Äôt enough. But Mr. Krukowski casts serious doubt on the idea that streaming can, in any way meaningful to artists, replace the CD/vinyl/iTunes mode of music distribution.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:p35844181348-1\">\n<p>I came across Mr. Krukowski‚Äôs article via a post about it on <a href=\"http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/11/15/divorced-from-music/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Candler Blog</em></a> by Jonathan Poritsky.¬†<a href=\"p35844181348-1\" rev=\"footnote\" target=\"_blank\">‚Ü©</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

With regard to blogs and forums, particularly, there‚Äôs a strong analogy with letter-writing and other modes of communication with the ‚Äúoutside‚Äù that are typically allowed.</p>\n\n<p>The plaintiffs, two registered California sex offenders, argue that prohibiting their anonymous speech online ‚Äúeven if it pertains to news, politics, and professional activity, and could not possibly be used to commit a crime‚Äù violates the First Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>This looks similar to a case I <a href=\"http://joeross.me/post/33905230393/nebraska-court-strikes-down-restrictions-on-internet\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about in October</a>, where a Nebraska federal court tossed a similar law in that state.</p>\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt want sex offenders to have access to children online. But these measures do go too far. Maybe registered sex offenders should be required to access the internet via special software that, while it allows anonymity, prevents access to services and sites that reach children.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, the truth is that these laws apply to people who have otherwise served their time, who are ‚Äúfree‚Äù in the legal sense, and who no longer labor under the curtailed liberties of institutional imprisonment. That imprisonment is meant to punish them, but also to keep the public safe, to prevent them from moving through public crowds anonymously.</p>\n\n<p>If we have released them from prison, allowing that physical anonymity once again, by what logic do we eliminate their digital anonymity?</p>\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt have an answer, but I suspect the issue will reach the Supreme Court sooner rather than later.</p>\n</div>\n",

His focus, as he points out in his <em>Volokh Conspiracy</em> post, was on the overbroad nature of the statute barring internet use by sex offenders, which he believes, and the <a href=\"http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">United States District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> agreed, was beyond what the First Amendment allows.</p>\n\n<p>Your first thought might be ‚Äúwho cares about a sex offender‚Äôs free speech rights?‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>The answer, of course, is that the Constitution cares, particularly after they have served prison time and otherwise complied with constitutionally sound penalties for their crimes.</p>\n\n<p>The core of the court‚Äôs holding lies in the following passage:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The ban not only restricts the exchange of text between adults; it also restricts the exchange of oral and video communication between adults. Moreover, the ban potentially restricts the targeted offenders from communicating with hundreds of millions and perhaps billions of adults and their companies despite the fact that the communication has nothing whatsoever to do with minors.<sup id=\"fnref:p33905230393-1\"><a href=\"p33905230393-1\" rel=\"footnote\" target=\"_blank\">1</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This looks to me like a well-meaning statute, meant to keep sex offenders away from kids online, that was very poorly drafted. You could achieve the desired goal using far narrower provisions. I hope someone proposes a corrected statute to that effect.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:p33905230393-1\">\n<p>The decision, filed on October 17, is not yet ‚Äúreported,‚Äù but it can be accessed by those with Westlaw access using the cite <em>Doe v.

It‚Äôs unfortunate but true that the Aol brand is really a handicap to anyone trying to do something as bold as redesigning how we use email.

Google got hammered by voluminous coverage because, in the minds of the tech press and many consumers, what they do with data <em>matters</em>. Microsoft, on the other hand, is not seen as an important player in the consumer data space. That perception may be inaccurate, particularly with the generally positive reaction to, if not widespread adoption of, <a href=\"http://www.skydrive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SkyDrive</a> and the new <a href=\"http://www.outlook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But it‚Äôs there: when it comes to privacy, Google is search and email and Android. Microsoft is, well, not much. Windows 8 and Surface may change that, but no one is holding their breath. In short, this looks like a case in which Microsoft got let less critical press coverage than they may have wanted: people complain about the things that are important to them. The unimportant things get ignored.</p>\n</div>\n",

He is no threat to me, whatsoever. He is no threat to this country, whatsoever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kenney doesn‚Äôt like the immigration policy pushed by some ‚Äúlunatics in Harrisburg‚Äù and wishes they would ‚Äúexempt the city of Philadelphia‚Äù when they pass harsh immigration measures. Further, he stated that if he were mayor he wouldn‚Äôt cooperate with <a href=\"http://www.ice.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Immigration and  Customs Enforcement</a> (presumably beyond what the law requires).</p>\n\n<p>I think there are more eloquent and nuanced ways to make the argument against strong immigration restrictions and criminalizing undocumented immigrants, but I respect the hell out of Kenney‚Äôs verve for the issue, which he said reminds him of problems his Irish ancestors faced in the earlier days of our nation.</p>\n</div>\n",

Nationwide, they‚Äôve helped employ more than half a million workers (560,000) who contributed $63 billion in sales just in 2012.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those numbers demand superlatives: they‚Äôre <em>staggering</em>. The common assumption is that immigrants do jobs US citizens don‚Äôt want to do. This research would seem to turn those assumptions upside-down: immigrants often do jobs for which US policy, educational institutions, and deeply-ingrained social strictures simply leave our young people unprepared.</p>\n\n<p>My Citizenship and Immigration class meets twice weekly, on Monday and Wednesday evenings. It really is a fascinating class, and offers a broadened perspective on a hot political issue this election season.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I‚Äôve learned from <a href=\"http://www.law.temple.edu/Pages/Faculty/N_Faculty_Spiro_Main.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Peter Spiro</a> (of <a href=\"http://opiniojuris.org/author/peter-spiro/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Opinio Juris</em></a> and much <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=223948\" target=\"_blank\">scholarship</a>), and from research like Mr. Wadhwa‚Äôs, is that immigration policy is not as amenable to applause-worthy one-liners as political candidates would prefer it to be.</p>\n\n<p>The angle on Mr. Wadhwa‚Äôs recent research, and Mr. Ferenstein‚Äôs <em>TechCrunch</em> post, is that immigrant participation in US entrepreneurialism may have peaked already. I wonder, not cynically or rhetorically, but <em>genuinely wonder</em>, whether the US will be able to replace them with adequately-inspired and prepared citizens of its own, and whether the nation wouldn‚Äôt benefit from incentivizing continued and increased opportunities for citizens and immigrants alike.</p>\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt know what that policy direction should look like, but I think it‚Äôs worth thinking, and most importantly, talking about.</p>\n</div>\n",

However, you can now choose between a master feed including all updates, a links-only feed that only includes the links I share (updated at least once a day), or an articles-only feed that includes only longer articles (updated at least once a week). Find more information <a href=\"http://joeross.me/subscribe\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That‚Äôs it. I hope you find at least one of these additions useful. I don‚Äôt plan to add to this site very often, as part of the goal in building it was to keep it clean and content-focused.</p>\n",

Then I <a href=\"http://joeross.me/post/31863450609/david-hoffman-on-quotation-approval\" target=\"_blank\">expressed my agreement</a> with Temple Law professor David Hoffman, who wrote at <em>Concurring Opinions</em> about the frequency with which experts such as himself are misquoted or taken out of context.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm not sure the <em>Times</em> policy does a very good job of distinguishing between approval by PR folks and approval by subject-matter experts. The former try to approve quotes to control messaging, while the latter try to approve quotes to ensure their opinions on a given issue aren‚Äôt manipulated to further a skewed narrative.</p>\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt think those two cases can be dealt with in the same policy without explicitly pointing them out and setting up a framework for each one. The <em>Times</em> policy allows for exceptions with senior editorial approval, and that may allow experts like Professor Hoffman to explain that they want to ensure their comments are presented in the manner in which they intend them to be presented. Or, it may not.</p>\n\n<p>Marco Arment <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2012/09/19/quote-approval\" target=\"_blank\">suggested disclosing</a> when quotes have been approved for an article, instead of calling for an unqualified end to the practice. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the <em>perfect</em> solution, but I think I prefer Mr. Arment‚Äôs policy to the <em>Times</em> policy.</p>\n\n<p>Disclosure makes sense and would show great respect to readers by allowing them to decide whether the reliability of a particular quote is or is not affected by its pre-approval by the source. Experts could ensure accurate representation of their opinions, and readers could be kept in the loop when a communications department has manufactured the CEO‚Äôs statement to the paper.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the <em>Times</em> quote policy is nothing less than a good start, but it‚Äôs also nothing more.</p>\n",

This morning, I found that Professor David Hoffman, whose corporate law class I took at Temple Law, had posted his own thoughts at <em>Concurring Opinions</em>.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>Specifically, this part stuck out to me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There‚Äôs a simple reason that most sources (including me) ask for quote approval: we don‚Äôt trust reporters to avoid making a hash out of our comments, pulling quotes selectively to fit a pre-existing narrative, and consequently turning the source into the reporter‚Äôs sock puppet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Professor Hoffman‚Äôs reaction illustrates an important distinction that we need to make in thinking about the integrity of quote approval. I think that experts have a right to approve not only their quotes, but the context in which those quotes will appear.</p>\n\n<p>After all, a journalist‚Äôs use of an expert extends beyond the quote, and can be honest or manipulative depending on the integrity of the journalist in question. The press <em>seeks</em> quotes from experts like Professor Hoffman, and I believe their seeking creates an obligation to accurately report not only the words but the context.</p>\n\n<p>However, David Carr‚Äôs thesis on the problem with quote approval holds true when those approvals are coming from public relations departments or firms, campaigns, or others who actively <em>seek</em> press coverage. The difference is between controlling the narrative (in the case of PR) and ensuring accurate context (in the case of experts).</p>\n</div>\n",

Meanwhile, the damn thing throws a force-close dialogue every couple of hours, stutters whenever I try to switch between apps, and occasionally reboots itself just for fun.</p>\n\n<p>My fianc√©e has had an iPhone 4 for a little over a year, so I‚Äôve had a lot of time to sit on the couch late at night and compare the two phones (like the unashamed geek one has to be to do such things‚Ä¶). The verdict is clear, quick, and simple: go Android for customization and Gmail (a far bigger point in Android‚Äôs favor than non-Gmail users might imagine‚Ä¶) but go iPhone for stability and app availability.</p>\n\n<p>That has been the state of things for some time, and it‚Äôs no different with the introduction of the iPhone 5, iOS 6, or Android Jelly Bean.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 29 this year, but my desire to customize the hell out of my phone is fading fast, especially at the high cost of stability. I‚Äôll always keep an Android phone or two around for playing with custom ROMs, but I need something more refined for my primary phone.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I‚Äôve found on other Android devices that the four-inch display is my preference. The older iPhone displays were too small, and the Galaxy Nexus, at 4.6 inches, is a bit too large. Some people are complaining that iPhone 5 looks the same, just as the 4S looked the same. But it doesn‚Äôt: it has a bigger display and a thinner depth, without sacrificing anything in the spec department. That‚Äôs change enough for me.</p>\n\n<p>Honan nailed it: iPhone 5 is great and it‚Äôs whatever. But it‚Äôs stable, app-rich, uniformly-updated whatever. And unless my first experience with it in a store or from a friend‚Äôs unit is surprisingly negative, it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting the next time I need a new phone.</p>\n",

I just don‚Äôt agree that there is <em>any</em> probable circumstance in which the iPhone 5 marks the beginning of the end of Apple‚Äôs dominance. I <em>want</em> him to be right, but I believe it will take <em>action</em> on the part of Apple‚Äôs competitors, rather than mere <em>inaction</em> from Cupertino, to catalyze that descent from the pinnacle.</p>\n\n<p>I want to see something truly threaten Apple‚Äôs dominance: it would be good for consumers and even good for Apple, potentially motivating just the sort of next-generation innovation everyone wishes we saw with the iPhone 5. But Android is peddled in an ever-changing array of hardware of wildly varying quality, its interface often marred by manufacturer ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù and carrier-mandated bloatware, with no cohesive or remotely predictable software upgrade schedule.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, it‚Äôs customizable, ‚Äúopen‚Äù (depending on how you define the term), and a provider of competitive pressure. In fact, Android, the <em>OS</em>, in its pristine Jelly Bean state on glorious hardware, is functional and gorgeous. But Android, the <em>experience</em> and, for lack of a better word, the <em>brand</em>, is truly a mess.</p>\n\n<p>Then, there is the iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>Apple tried for years to make things people loved. They succeeded. Now they are in the business of making <em>improvements</em> on the things they make that people love. And they‚Äôre succeeding there, too.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not they revolutionize TV next, and whether or not they drastically refresh iOS in the next couple of years, I think they‚Äôre still comfortably in the middle of their dominance, and at the top of their game.</p>\n",

Or like most of us who are successful Americans, we automatically assume that our stance on individual rights and belief in the individualistic survival of the fittest / the elite will rise are ‚Äúideal‚Äù or ‚Äúoptimal.‚Äù.  Another example is our cultural bias towards the ‚Äúcult of the celebrity.‚Äù. And we tend to measure success by economic output.</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is geared toward inhabitants of the Silicon Valley ‚Äúisland‚Äù on which so many people become detached from reality, but much of it applies generally to life in a first-world country, as well.</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently had the pleasure of attending the Second Annual <a href=\"http://www.phillygeekawards.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Philly Geek Awards</a>. It was an amazing experience, but far better recaps than anything I can do are already available (like <a href=\"http://ericsmithrocks.com/2012/08/20/the-philly-geek-awards-harder-better-faster-stronger/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://kylecassidy.livejournal.com/722711.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, so I‚Äôll keep this to around 500 words.</p>\n\n<p><em>Warning: May contain italics and optimism.</em></p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>There were over <del>two</del> FIVE(! ‚Ä¶sorry <a href=\"http://www.ericsmithrocks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric</a>!) hundred people there, representing geekdom of all types. There were scientists, foodies, comic book artists, filmmakers, comedians, web designers, indie game and app developers, and many more. The sheer diversity of geekery going on Philadelphia is amazing. But the gathering, and the award ceremony in particular, have become much more than the sum of their parts.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, the first annual Philly Geek Awards proved to the City and its geeks that the Age of Geek is here to stay in Philadelphia. Geek may be the new cool when it comes to pop culture, but there is no shortage of 100% pure geek street-cred in Philly. It‚Äôs not a fashion trend (although Philly geeks clean up very well, myself included). It‚Äôs also <a href=\"http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/arts-culture/41054-philly-geek-awards-nominees-led-by-girl-geeks\" target=\"_blank\">not a boys‚Äô club</a> (Spoiler alert: Ms. Hightower won 2012 Geek of the Year!).</p>\n\n<p>The first ceremony cemented the presence and importance of this city‚Äôs geek community.</p>\n\n<p>It was refreshing.</p>\n\n<p>This year, the second annual Geek Awards proved that Philly‚Äôs geeks are not satisfied merely to be recognized. They are building, connecting, and developing communities, online and off, all over Philadelphia and at an unprecedented pace. This time, it was more than refreshing:</p>\n\n<p>It was inspiring.</p>\n\n<p>That‚Äôs because what I saw, and what I could feel in the air, was a sense not only of like-mindedness when it comes to community and innovation, but an even stronger sense that we can, and should, work together for a better city.</p>\n\n<p>I realize that by the end of that last sentence, I started to sound like a politician. Maybe that‚Äôs okay: with any luck, some of the Geek Awards attendees, or their friends, or their spouses, or their children, will become a politician, or work for one. If anyone can overcome the absurdity of politics, it‚Äôs a Philly geek.</p>\n\n<p>Then there are the companies, the publications, the government partnerships, the music records, the software, and more that will come from the massive, wonderful brains of Philly‚Äôs geeks.</p>\n\n<p>Enough about the future. What about today?</p>\n\n<p>Every city needs such a perfect way to unite, reward, and inspire its geeks. Only recently has Philly‚Äôs true geekery started to find its way into government (a beat covered masterfully by <a href=\"http://technicallyphilly.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Technically Philly</em></a>). There are undoubtedly geeks across America making <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_comic\" target=\"_blank\">rage faces</a> at their city‚Äôs website or longing to meet other geeks. Geek Awards are the answer.</p>\n\n<p>The Philly Geek Awards are about what Philly‚Äôs geeks, of all types, are doing <em>today</em> to improve their communities, their city, and their world. It‚Äôs about people, coming together and <em>making stuff</em>, at art collectives, coworking spaces, and universities all over Philly, <em>right now</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There‚Äôs nothing more inspiring than that.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>This is a story within a story. The outer story is about Reverend Robert Carlson, who killed himself recently amid a sexual abuse investigation. This post isn‚Äôt about that story. It‚Äôs about the inner story, about a reporter using a copyrighted photo without attribution, and claiming fair use when the photographer realizes it.</p>\n\n<p><em>Summary:</em> Steve Mistler of the <em>Portland Press Herald</em> <a href=\"http://www.pressherald.com/news/husson-let-chaplain-join-events-after-he-quit_2012-08-07.html\" target=\"_blank\">plagiarized</a> a photo by <a href=\"http://lovelikesalt.posterous.com/sure-its-fair-but-is-it-right\" target=\"_blank\">Audrey Slade</a> and when she requested they take it down he told her it was fair use. I think he is wrong, his reporting was solid and didn‚Äôt require a photo, he should take the photo down, and he should apologize to Slade for plagiarizing her photo.</p>\n\n<hr><p>Steve Mistler of the <em>Portland Press Herald</em> used a photo taken by Audrey Slade, who worked at Husson University while Carlson was there but didn‚Äôt take the photo in her capacity as an employee. Mister didn‚Äôt request permission to use Slade‚Äôs photo, and he didn‚Äôt attribute the photo to her. He found the photo on Slade‚Äôs Flickr account, labelled as ‚ÄúAll Rights Reserved,‚Äù and published it with <a href=\"http://www.pressherald.com/news/husson-let-chaplain-join-events-after-he-quit_2012-08-07.html\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a> about Carlson.</p>\n\n<p>The appropriate course of action was to contact Slade either via contact information on her Flickr profile or via Flickr‚Äôs built-in messaging system. If she replied granting permission, run the photo. If she denied permission, or didn‚Äôt reply at all, don‚Äôt run the photo. Instead, the reporter used the copyrighted photo without permission and later, in an email exchange Slade <a href=\"http://lovelikesalt.posterous.com/sure-its-fair-but-is-it-right\" target=\"_blank\">published on her blog</a>, claimed fair use.</p>\n\n<p>Mistler‚Äôs failure to seek out and use Flickr‚Äôs messaging system suggests to me that he didn‚Äôt <em>want</em> to contact Slade.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm not going to write in-depth about fair use, but you can find good basic information at the U.S. <a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html\" target=\"_blank\">Copyright Office</a>, <a href=\"http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/\" target=\"_blank\">Standford University</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>. The <em>Herald</em>'s use of Slade's photo is not, in my educated opinion, fair. The newspaper is a for-profit enterprise, the copyrighted work is a photograph for which false attribution can easily be claimed, the newspaper did not transform the work in any way, and they used it in its entirety.</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Slade sent some very polite messages asking them to take them down, and even offered to handle invoicing them for continued usage (by the way, I think that is wonderful, regardless of whether it would hold up in court). Mistler could have replied asking whether attribution would convince her to allow the newspaper‚Äôs continued publication of the photo on their website. Slade probably would have said no, but it would have demonstrated that Mistler was aware of his mistake. Instead, he gave Slade two justifications for his perfunctory infringement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(1) We could not, by deadline, determine who the photo belonged to, and (2) we ultimately decided it was in the public‚Äôs interest to publish them. The story was, in essence, about the evidence that Rev. Carlson was still partaking in Husson activities for years after supposedly being told he was no longer welcome.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the photo <em>proved</em> that claim, Mistler‚Äôs reasoning goes, so it <em>had</em> to be in the article. Except Mistler got the former President of the University to admit to the allegations in the article, a far more powerful confirmation than a plagiarized, undated photo.</p>\n\n<p>That was the wrong answer, legally and ethically.</p>\n\n<p>Now Slade has published the email addresses of several <em>Herald</em> employees (all, I think, publicly available anyway), and a commenter has posted some phone numbers (one of which is a cell phone number and likely <em>not</em> meant to be public).</p>\n\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt my photo they used without permission as part of a for-profit enterprise, but I can say that if it was, this whole thing would be more about principle than money or the law: be authentic with readers and respectful of sources and copyright holders.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, there was no fair use in this situation, and there was no <em>need</em> for the ‚Äúunfair‚Äù use in the first place because there was real reporting behind the story. Hopefully, Mistler and the <em>Herald</em> will do the right thing and remove that photo, preferably adding an apology to Slade and their readers at the bottom of the article for the previous use of an unlicensed photo.</p>\n",

She is right; I should have focused on wanting her take on what I describe below as the interesting bits and not on her revision. She also told me I should have asked her. She is right about that, too. I stand by my wanting some analysis of the areas I mention below where Mayer‚Äôs memo departs from PR speak, but to the extent that my post appeared to question Ms. Swisher‚Äôs integrity, I am sorry._</p>\n\n<hr><p>Kara Swisher, <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120719/yes-keep-moving-marissa-mayers-first-memo-to-yahoos-natch/\" target=\"_blank\">writing at <em>All Things D</em></a> about new Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer‚Äôs recent memo to employees:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I took that to heart in tracking down this do-not-forward (oops) memo ‚Äî- which I changed around &gt; a bit to thwart those who try to stop me from getting these emails via tricky computer programs [‚Ä¶]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>‚ÄúChanged around a bit‚Äù to what extent? Does that diminish or eliminate the value, if any, of the memo to readers? Was there any value to readers to begin with? My answers are probably ‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù respectively.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm not the only one thinking these things, <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120719/yes-keep-moving-marissa-mayers-first-memo-to-yahoos-natch/#comment-593020059\" target=\"_blank\">some</a> commenters <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120719/yes-keep-moving-marissa-mayers-first-memo-to-yahoos-natch/#comment-593127389\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> the same questions. I think Ms. Swisher should have analyzed the interesting parts of the memo, posting little or none of the actual text. It would have been better use of her knowledge and skills, and would have been more valuable to readers.</p>\n\n<p>The memo itself is nothing special. I can summarize it as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to be here, I think Yahoo! is great, I have big plans, but don‚Äôt stop doing what you‚Äôre doing (unless you hear otherwise) until I learn more about the company‚Äôs management culture and direction.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>But Ms. Swisher‚Äôs casual mention that she edited it gives me pause. It‚Äôs not exactly a sensitive diplomatic report, but mysterious edits by a journalist to a document originally written by the subject of the article make me uneasy.</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Swisher is laudably dogged about disclosing her spouse‚Äôs role as an executive at Google. There is a link to her <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/about/kara-swisher/ethics/\" target=\"_blank\">disclosure and ethics policy</a> at the bottom of all her articles. That‚Äôs why this offhand mention of memo-revision reads as out of place to me.</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Swisher could have published the unedited version of the memo as an image, likely thwarting any ‚Äútricky computer programs‚Äù aimed at preventing her future access to such internal emails in the future. Alternatively, she could have simnply written about the bits that weren‚Äôt cliche corporate-speak.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Ms. Mayer said in the memo that ‚ÄúWhile I have some ideas, I need to develop a more informed perspective before making strategy or direction changes.‚Äù That suggests the pace of change at Yahoo! under her leadership may initially be slower than observers would like, but will likely accelerate as she soaks up institutional knowledge about how the company functions.</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting bit says ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt stop. If you have questions or concerns about whether to continue or not, please ask. However, with the exception of a few things that might heavily constrain us in the future, the answer is most likely: Yes, keep moving.‚Äù What is going on at Yahoo! right now that ‚Äúmight heavily constrain‚Äù them in the future if employees don‚Äôt pull the plug?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Ms. Mayer said ‚ÄúWe will continue to invest in talent, so we can produce the most compelling and exciting user experiences anywhere.‚Äù That tracks with <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/dearinternet\" target=\"_blank\">the Flickr team‚Äôs response</a> to <a href=\"http://dearmarissamayer.com\" target=\"_blank\">dearmarissamayer.com</a>, asking people to apply for jobs there.</p>\n\n<p>But does Ms. Mayer‚Äôs comment suggest that Yahoo! will be ramping up compensation and benefits, going on a hiring and expansion spree to bet the company on a new army of innovators, or just building out the kind of infrastructure and marketing that will make current employees proud to work there again?</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Swisher is a journalist and I am not a journalist. She is talented and successful, and no doubt has a better editorial sensibility (or at least a more refined one) than I do. But I can‚Äôt help thinking that a breakdown of the memo‚Äôs telling points would have been more worthy of her efforts and our reading time than posting it in its entirety with some unknown edits.</p>\n",

I‚Äôm posting <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_fiction\" target=\"_blank\">flash fiction</a> there, because I love to write it and it‚Äôs the best I can do length-wise until I finish my JD in December (a semester early, if you‚Äôre counting, which I am ‚Ä¶ <em>pats self on back</em>). It‚Äôs going to be mostly but not <em>all</em> science fiction, so if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing, please check it out and tell me what you think.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>I have been writing fiction since, probably, ever. My first short story was a survival tale about a man‚Äôs struggle in the wilderness. Alas, I can‚Äôt find it, but I wrote it in high school and I remember being <em>super</em> proud of it. Survival? Wilderness? Sold!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I wrote another story in college, call <em>Three Days</em>, which you can get for free <a href=\"http://leanpub.com/threedays\" target=\"_blank\">in eBook format at Leanpub</a>. Did I mention that it‚Äôs <em>free</em>? Go get it. It has an epidemic, love, psychiatry, and time travel.</p>\n\n<p>I know, genius.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and <strong>it‚Äôs okay to tell me you don‚Äôt like stuff</strong>.

Of course, it won‚Äôt kill me to hear from you even if you <em>did</em> like it, but constructive criticism is wonderful.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, I‚Äôm one of those obnoxious people who doesn‚Äôt <em>mind</em> telling you I‚Äôm in law school, and working full time, and kind of a big deal because of all that. The bottom line is, though, that I never have much time to write, the little time I <em>do</em> have I use mostly to write about tech news and law stuff, and I have <em>no</em> time at all to edit. So I‚Äôve been hoarding all these little scenes of mine, sometimes for years. That hoarding, for better or worse, has come to an end.</p>\n\n<p>As of the publication of this post, I‚Äôve already put up two scenes, <a href=\"http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/26915282022/carnival-time\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Carnival Time</em></a> and <a href=\"http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/27079728829/the-deaths-of-dolly-dignan\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Deaths of Dolly Dignan</em></a>.

When Flipboard becomes that, I would love to reengage and reinvigorate our product. Until then, we have to wait and see and not allow intermediaries to build their own platforms without direct monetizable benefit back to us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is somewhere between a rock and a hard place. People who consume solely through Flipboard ‚Äî a group I suspect is growing all the time ‚Äî might not bother clicking through. The friction meant to induce users to view Wired.com might end up dramatically cutting the number of folks reading Wired‚Äôs content. I don‚Äôt know what the right answer is, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äúteaser‚Äù sentences.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>The ad experience on mobile is already dismal for the user ‚Äî I only interact with mobile ads by accident. There must be a better way. I know <em>Wired</em> and other content creators need viable revenue streams, and that traditionally the primary stream has been advertising.</p>\n\n<p>But the web, particularly the mobile web, doesn‚Äôt even allow for the glossy full-pagers that magazines do. Those full-pagers can be compelling, and what‚Äôs more, they can be blended with the magazine itself.</p>\n\n<p>A glossy full-page ad about the newest gaming laptop would be well-received in an issue focusing on gaming hardware, consoles, and next-generation systems. The same connection is much harder to make on mobile, where space is as precious to the publisher selling the ads as it is to the reader teaching himself how to visually avoid them. Flipboard is so popular because it involves us in the content consumption beyond merely staring at a screen. It‚Äôs subtle, but that flip is oddly engaging.</p>\n\n<p>If the platform won‚Äôt accomodate your advertising, it‚Äôs time for your advertising to accomodate the platform. A headline and a single teaser sentence make for bad user experience: either find a way to participate in full, or get out altogether. Half-measures suggest a lack of innovation and a willingness to make user experience secondary to revenue, when user experience is what brings (and keeps) the eyeballs that bring (and keep) the advertising dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Why can‚Äôt an advertisement be ‚ÄúFlipboard-ized?‚Äù Why not include in <em>Wired</em>'s Flipboard stream an article entitled ‚ÄúAd: Alienware M18x Moves Gaming Laptops into the 21st Century,‚Äù accompanied by stunning images of the inner workings and outer design of the machine? This offers the same ‚Äúunified experience‚Äù of which a full-page print magazine ad is capable, but maintains the user experience that makes Flipboard so popular.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated 8:30pm:</strong>  <em>Alexia Tsotsis <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/25/die-less-slow/\" target=\"_blank\">briefly interviewed Flipboard CEO Mike McCue</a> about the New York Times‚Äô integration into Flipboard. All digital subscribers to the Times can access the newspaper‚Äôs full array of online content via Flipboard. More interesting is the fact that the paper‚Äôs Flipboard content will also include advertisements described by McCue as ‚Äúfull page, print style advertising.‚Äù I respectfully request some credit for at least independently coming up with the model used by the Flipboard/NYT partnership (I somehow missed Tsotsis‚Äô headline while writing this post), but I‚Äôm happy to see someone is at least trying it out.</em></p>\n\n<p>Something like this seems to be working for Facebook on mobile, according <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/facebook-mobile-ads/\" target=\"_blank\">a story by Josh Constine at <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. Facebook‚Äôs formidable <del>data farm</del> social network struggled to find a viable advertising solution to massive uptake in mobile use, and they appear to be on to something.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe organic inline advertising isn‚Äôt the solution for every mobile advertising problem, but it‚Äôs an example of the fact that this problem is solvable. My Flipboard/<em>Wired</em> suggestion probably has weaknesses, but let‚Äôs have that conversation. Let‚Äôs argue about how the interests of publishers, users, and adverstisers, for all of their apparent conflict, often converge on great value propositions: content <em>and</em> ads that are well-built, well-tailored, and complimentary to one another, rather than shoe-horned next to one another in a way that damages the user experience and decreases all forms of value for everyone.</p>\n",

They might make decent money in the long run by selling subscriptions. However, this limited availability also breeds pirates, and one has to wonder how easy it is to convert these people to subscriptions once they have experienced BitTorrent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>TorrentFreak</em> is unabashedly pro-torrent and, some might argue, pro-piracy if necessary. And they don‚Äôt exactly divulge great detail on their methodology for determining downloads and viewership. But, let‚Äôs assume for the sake of a blog post that their numbers are accurate.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> pulled an estimated 4.2 million legitimate (read: cable-subscribed) viewers per episode <em>and</em> 3.9 million illegal torrent downloads per episode during its second season. You could even, <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5916885/more-people-pirate-game-of-thrones-than-watch-game-of-thrones-on-hbo\" target=\"_blank\">as <em>Gizmodo</em>'s Casey Chan did</a>, pull legitimate viewership numbers <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_(TV_series)\" target=\"_blank\">from Wikipedia</a> and use <em>those</em> alongside TorrentFreak‚Äôs download numbers to come ot the conclusion that more people pirated the second season than legally watched it. I don‚Äôt think you need to massage the numbers, though:</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p><strong>When legitimate and illegitimate viewership are nearly or actually equal, the market has spoken.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This isn‚Äôt about prognostication. There is, at this very moment, an untapped market that rivals the current market, and HBO and other premium television content creators are ignoring it in favor of the legacy model. But maintaining cable deals is a short-term no-brainer for HBO. My own anecodtal market study turns up many torrent-happy people who assure me without blinking that they would pay for HBO every month. I don‚Äôt know what the reality would look like, but things are getting interesting.</p>\n\n<p>As you may know, I‚Äôm not very good at math, but just for fun:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3.8 million illegal downloaders (according to <em>TorrentFreak</em>);  </li>\n<li>divided by 2 (assuming only half would ever pay);  </li>\n<li>multiplied by $20 (per month);  </li>\n<li>multiplied by 12 (months in a year);  </li>\n<li>equals <strong>$456 million</strong> (that‚Äôs almost <em>half a billion dollars</em>)</li>\n</ul><p>Yes, those numbers are dubious, but the exercise is still indicative that there is something going on here. Does HBO pull more than half a billion dollars from its current cable deals? I don‚Äôt know. If so, I suppose an independent subscription model still doesn‚Äôt make sense.

Their website is a Wordpress installation. That‚Äôs fine for weblogs of note, like this one, but unless you‚Äôve hired a solid designer and/or developer, Wordpress probably won‚Äôt cut it for a publishing website.</p>\n\n<p>The company fumbles even worse in basing the majority of the site‚Äôs content on Amazon API calls. Amazon has presumably updated something in their API since Superior Formatting Publishing (really, two -ing words in a row?) because most of the site says only ‚ÄúWhoops, looks like there was a problem get the book data from Amazon. Please try again in a moment‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúAmazon API Error.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>\"Philip\" makes the point that \"the ease with which anyone can commit such jackassetry with an ebook and a simple, stupid \"find and replace\" function. He says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It makes one wary of the integrity of any digital version of not only War and Peace‚Ä¶but any e-book.‚Äô</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He‚Äôs right. Sure, people could always publish altered versions of a text in the past, but it‚Äôs far easier to do with digital content than the paper stuff. This instance involves what looks like a very low-budget ‚Äúpublisher,‚Äù but there are many such publishers out there, often with cut-rate prices.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder how many others are find-and-replacing classic works of literature.  Are all such changes merely stupid, like changing ‚Äúkindle‚Äù to ‚ÄúNook‚Äù in the hopes (I assume) of avoiding some automated removal from the Nook store? Or are there people out there making the dangerous, destructive changes about which Philip opines?</p>\n\n<p>Apple <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/apple-publishers-expressed-varying-degrees-of-unhappiness-with-amazon/\" target=\"_blank\">still faces legal action</a> from multiple angles on the ebook front, and most big publishers and sellers know that this is still a nascent market.</p>\n\n<p>But that‚Äôs what worries me: will the continued growth of the legitimate ebook publishing market mean the continued growth of D-list wannabes like Superior Formatting Publishing? How can we address the potential for the sale of covertly-altered literature? Is it something for the Federal Trade Commission to look into, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/apple-publishers-expressed-varying-degrees-of-unhappiness-with-amazon/\" target=\"_blank\">as they did with blogger endorsements</a>?</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm always wary of increased government regulation as long as there‚Äôs a way for the market to take care of itself, but I fear there may always be a market for dirt-cheap ebook editions of literary works, sold with or without the right authorization (public domain, licensing, etc.), and with or without the text as it was actually written by the author.</p>\n\n<p>We should all be careful and discerning about which publishers we go to for ebook editions of the books we want to buy.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://futureoftheinternet.org/war-and-nookd\" target=\"_blank\">Hat -tip</a> to Professor Zittrain, on whose site I first read about this</em></p>\n",

I have no ‚Äúofficial‚Äù user experience training, but both of my reasons might be considered UX critiques:</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>First, Facebook login suggests an interest in reducing friction, but my experience was anything but smooth. The So.cl page offers to let you <em>sign in</em>, so I tried to sign in with my personal email address but was told that address wasn‚Äôt connected to a registered Windows Live account. So I tried to register the same email address with Windows Live. Then, I was told it was already connected to a Windows Live account. I registered a different email address as a new Windows Live account and then got a landing page saying they‚Äôd send me an invitation ASAP. So much for signing in.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook has its claws in  Microsoft‚Äôs little social experiment, and it‚Äôs probably <em>profoundly</em> easier to use than Microsoft‚Äôs own sign-up/in process. Unfortunately, anyone who doesn‚Äôt have a Facebook account must brave Microsoft‚Äôs abysmal Windows Live process. No third way. This is a classic case of fail, and Danny Sullivan‚Äôs experience, which he wrote about at his <a href=\"http://marketingland.com/microsoft-launches-so-cl-social-network-a-quick-look-12499\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Marketing Land</em></a> website, suggests the problems I had trying to get into the damn thing only continue as you dig deeper.</p>\n\n<p>Second, Microsoft did stuff it didn‚Äôt need to waste time doing: creating a stand-alone site and allowing users to: make ‚Äúrich‚Äù posts (read: blog), ‚Äúriff‚Äù on other posts (read: reblog, a la Tumblr), and conduct ‚Äúvideo parties‚Äù (read: Google Hangouts, but with less features).</p>\n\n<p>As usual, I have some unsolicited advice for a massive technology corporation:</p>\n\n<p>First, let users sign up with an email address. If you want to make that email address automatically a new Windows Live account, fine, but don‚Äôt ask for ZIP code and gender while you do it. Don‚Äôt use multiple redirects to sign-up stages, either. Make it <em>simple</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Second, just integrate the experiment into <a href=\"http://bing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bing.com</a> itself, which looks better every time I visit it. Show users a very prominent one-time explanation and allow interested folks to opt into the experiment. Then, make the So.cl bits a minimal but eye-catching and <em>useful</em> sub-component of each search result or something. <em>Anything</em> but a distinct site. If it feels like a new feature, it‚Äôs not as off-putting as a stand-alone site, which can feel like a new hungry content monster users are expected to feed.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft has impressed many people with their design direction on Bing, as well as Windows 8 and Windows Phone (aside from the unfortunate fact that we‚Äôre still calling the last two things ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù at all). Simple user experience stuff like this though shows they still have much room for improvement.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, one of my favorite user experience designs is <a href=\"http://www.ifttt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ifttt</a>. Show us what you can help us do <em>and how to do it</em> in the same step. That, to me, is an epic UX win.</p>\n",

This way it‚Äôs easy to share and discuss your broadcast after it‚Äôs over.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now none of this is really new. Sites like Justin.tv and Ustream, among many others, have been doing this stuff for a long time. But those sites built their communities on top of their streaming services. What interests me about Hangouts On Air is that Google is building their streaming service on top of their community.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, one typically had to know about Ustream and similar services in order to seek them out and take advantage of what they offer. Google, on the other hand, is making the same technology available to myriad people who otherwise would never have considered whether or not they want to do a live video meeting/chat/interview/podcast. And if the functionality is baked into the Google+ apps for Android, users of that mobile OS won‚Äôt even need to download an additional app.</p>\n\n<p>I think that‚Äôs awesome. But I also know it comes with dangers. It‚Äôs an opportunity for, at best, loads more noise in Google+ and other social networking feeds as people experiment with this stuff. At worst, for users, it‚Äôs a great way to produce and disseminate spam, hate, and other assorted creepiness. At worst, for Google, it won‚Äôt get any traction at all outside the Google+ fan club. Maybe it will live and die inside Google+, only coming to the attention of non-Plussers when Google decides to shove the Plus platform in peoples‚Äô faces. But Hangouts is built with YouTube technology, and no one should doubt the potential for anything with that kind of foundation.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, there is an interesting tension here between Google and Hangouts On Air and Microsoft‚Äôs Skype. Right now, podcasting heavyweights like the <a href=\"http://twit.tv/\" target=\"_blank\">TWiT Network</a> rely heavily on Skype for much of their production. The video-calling software, however, is notoriously prone to dropped calls and ‚ÄúCyloning‚Äù‚Äîbreakdowns in audio and video quality. If Hangouts On Air can avoid those issues, it may become a viable alternative to Skype for those kinds of use cases.</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, Hangouts On Air puts Google on par with Ustream and others in the world of livestreaming news. Google can now function as a platform not only for the uploading and sharing of live video of political speeches, riots, and dispatches from convention floors, but for the distribution of that video content as it happens.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm sure I can‚Äôt predict all the implications Hangouts On Air will have down the road. But even if it doesn‚Äôt become wildly popular, it signals that Google is not content to make life searchable after the fact. They want to make it watchable, and interactive, as conversations happen.</p>\n",

Siegler seemed <a href=\"http://parislemon.com/post/20832114453/pando\" target=\"_blank\">as confused</a> as Arrington, because <a href=\"http://pandodaily.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>PandoDaily</em></a> founder <a href=\"http://pandodaily.com/author/pandosarahlacy/\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Lacey</a> knew about Arrington‚Äôs contractual obligation to speak at the conference when she took him on as an investor.</p>\n\n<p>What confuses <em>me</em> though is that Lacey disabled comments on her <a href=\"http://pandodaily.com/2012/04/09/investor-update/\" target=\"_blank\">post announcing Arrington‚Äôs removal</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Why? Well, it‚Äôs stupid to speculate, but I‚Äôm feeling stupid at the moment. Maybe comments were disabled‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Because they‚Äôll be largely negative? Maybe. Arrington and Siegler are full of a fire and insight that command pageviews like few other writers in the tech space.</li>\n<li>Because they would have been pointless? Maybe. After all, the deed is done.</li>\n<li>Because they would have been <em>positive</em> as in you-don‚Äôt-need-‚Äòem, casting aspersions on Arrington and Siegler, former colleagues and still friends of Lacey‚Äôs? Maybe, but that‚Äôs the nature of the beast.</li>\n<li>Because Lacey got some advice about minimizing speculation and keeping the focus on the content, not what goes on behind the scenes. </li>\n<li>Because Lacey got some advice about maximizing speculation and keeping the focus on both the content <em>and</em> what goes on behind the scenes. </li>\n<li>Because the <em>Pando‚Äô</em> board didn‚Äôt want to allow a potentially mean-spirited conversation about a decision they made on the site about which they made that decision. </li>\n</ol><p>I like PandoDaily. The writers are great, the focus is great, the content is great. And they have a healthy commenting community.</p>\n\n<p>All parties concerned are too thick-skinned for 1 or 3 to be accurate. 2 has never stopped a popular website from leaving comments enabled before.</p>\n\n<p>4 and 5 are doubtful because Lacey is smart enough to know both are good suggestions, depending on the topic in question and the nature of your publication.</p>\n\n<p>6 would just mean Lacey isn‚Äôt truly in control over there, and I find that very hard to believe.</p>\n\n<p>So, my speculation seems to have turned out just as stupidly as I had expected. Turns out I wasn‚Äôt the only one engaged in stupid speculation, though.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, <em>Business Insider</em>'s Matt Rosoff <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/pandodaily-splits-with-techcrunch-founder-mike-arrington-2012-4?op=1\" target=\"_blank\">claims</a> the Arrington/Siegler tag team at <em>Disrupt</em> ‚Äúpissed off PandoDaily CEO Andrew Anker,‚Äù implying that Arrington‚Äôs post about the issue suggested that. It didn‚Äôt, and Rosoff doesn‚Äôt mention any other potential source for the Anker line <em>at all</em>. Stupid speculation FTW!</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, people are talking about <em>Pando</em>, and that can‚Äôt be a bad thing.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n",
