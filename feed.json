				"content_text": "üîó [Apple Will Revamp Siri to Catch Up to Its Chatbot Competitors](\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/apple-siri-ai-chatgpt.html?unlocked_article_code%3D1.q00.NlEa.TZR9DORdS4C-%26smid%3Durl-share)\n\nTripp Mickle, Brian X. Chen and Cade Metz report at _The New York Times_ that:\n\n> The decision came after the executives Craig Federighi and John Giannandrea spent weeks testing OpenAI's new chatbot, ChatGPT. The product's use of generative artificial intelligence, which can write poetry, create computer code and answer complex questions, made Siri look antiquated, said two people familiar with the company's work, who didn't have permission to speak publicly.\n\nApple can't be serious here. My earliest [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) recipes made Siri look antiquated. Siri has been, to put it as politely as Siri deserves, trash for years. The user experience of the earliest [Echo Auto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo) was head and shoulders above Siri. If you need a reminder set, Siri will work more often than not. But that's been its only viable use case since release. \n\nApple has been [marketing off of machine learning since 2018](https://www.wired.com/story/apples-plans-to-bring-artificial-intelligence-to-your-phone/) and probably earlier, so it's just bonkers that they didn't decide to scrap Siri at least that long ago and turn their machine learning resources toward something better. \n",

I published it for my personal use and testing at <strong><em>joeross.dev/quicklinks</em></strong> and <strong><em>joeross.dev/quicklinks</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>But where there&#8217;s a new random webpage, there&#8217;s a geek running domain name searches&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>So, in keeping with my recent run of <a href=\"https://joeross.lol\" title=\"joeross.lol\">unnecessary</a> but <a href=\"https://joeross.dev\" title=\"joeross.dev\">fun</a> domain <a href=\"https://joe.rad.dad\" title=\"joe.rad.dad\">names</a>, I hereby present:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;font-size:2em;text-decoration:underline;letter-spacing:.15em;\"><a href=\"https://quicklinks.lol\">quicklinks.lol</a></p>\n\n<p>I have Big Dreams‚Ñ¢ of adding:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sidebar installation instructions for browsers that support sidebars;</li>\n<li>A dynamic new/same tab checkbox (a la <a href=\"https://techmeme.com\">Techmeme</a>); and</li>\n<li>An integrated way to customize the links.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://quicklinks.lol\">Quicklinks</a> is mostly for me, so it comes without promises. Most people who can code up something like this can do it far better than I can, and most who can&#8217;t will still be able to name two or three ways of doing the same thing without writing a single line of HTML. </p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s fine.
