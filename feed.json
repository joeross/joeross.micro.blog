It can be that, it‚Äôs happening again.\n\nThis immediately struck me as a perfect description of what I like about [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) and [Omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol). Each is made by a [person](https://adam.omg.lol/) or a [small team](https://micro.blog/about) who are constantly involved in the community, who we can report bugs to, suggest features to, or just chat with, and who greet criticism head-on with clear explanations of why they hold their positions, and who maintain a willingness to change their minds. \n\nI'm not saying they're perfect -- after all, like you and I, they're _people_, so of course they're not perfect. But that's just it: they're _people_, and they treat their users like they're people, too.\n\nWe get all of this because we pay a really, _really_ reasonable fee to join these communities, relieving them of the need to pursue increasingly questionable methods of revenue generation.\n\nThat's the web worth paying for, and I'm happy to be here.\n",

The writing, direction, acting and SOUND DESIGN are as good as the first and in some areas even better.¬†</p><p>The main flaw that bugged me was SPOILER ALERT:</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>The day one flashback was really only there to remind us who JK was on the first one and introduce us to Cillian and his kid. One or two more flashbacks throughout the story may have balanced it a bit. I wouldn‚Äôt want anything predictable like showing one of Emmit‚Äôs family members dying, I actually think not seeing that stuff puts us in his mindset: it‚Äôs hard for him to think about but it‚Äôs all he thinks about.¬†</p><p>I thought the conclusion was perfect, with the children both growing into their dad‚Äôs shoes, although it‚Äôs worth nothing that mom is consistently as badass and brave as dad. But when you lose someone you love you often want to live up to them somehow because it feels like they‚Äôre still there with you when you embody their best qualities. So I get it.</p>\n",
