It also includes some fuzzy search matches from your history and all that, which is fine 90% of the time, but sometimes you need a bit more control over what results it shows you.\n\n> <img src=\"uploads/2023/firefox-screenshot-2023-07-10t16-41-22.359z.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"197\" alt=\"Screenshot of Firefox address bar modifiers\">\n\nI had no idea.

The writing, direction, acting and SOUND DESIGN are as good as the first and in some areas even better.¬†</p><p>The main flaw that bugged me was SPOILER ALERT:</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>The day one flashback was really only there to remind us who JK was on the first one and introduce us to Cillian and his kid. One or two more flashbacks throughout the story may have balanced it a bit. I wouldn‚Äôt want anything predictable like showing one of Emmit‚Äôs family members dying, I actually think not seeing that stuff puts us in his mindset: it‚Äôs hard for him to think about but it‚Äôs all he thinks about.¬†</p><p>I thought the conclusion was perfect, with the children both growing into their dad‚Äôs shoes, although it‚Äôs worth nothing that mom is consistently as badass and brave as dad. But when you lose someone you love you often want to live up to them somehow because it feels like they‚Äôre still there with you when you embody their best qualities. So I get it.</p>\n",
