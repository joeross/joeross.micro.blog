But his good point and my agreement with it aren't really the reason I'm sharing a link to his post. \n\nI'm sharing it because he writes with the voice of a sage but slightly jaded manager who's just trying to save new developers from bad habits and messy code. It's refreshingly devoid of arrogance, and refreshingly full of practical examples of why his position makes sense. \n\nIt's also how I *try* to approach working with less experienced lawyers. Just replace \"developers\" with \"lawyers\" and \"code\" with \"argumentation.\"\n\n_Thanks to [Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/) for [linking](https://mastodon.social/@Meyerweb/110431206335150934) to Rupert's post on Mastodon, where I found it._\n",

The writing, direction, acting and SOUND DESIGN are as good as the first and in some areas even better. </p><p>The main flaw that bugged me was SPOILER ALERT:</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>The day one flashback was really only there to remind us who JK was on the first one and introduce us to Cillian and his kid. One or two more flashbacks throughout the story may have balanced it a bit. I wouldn’t want anything predictable like showing one of Emmit’s family members dying, I actually think not seeing that stuff puts us in his mindset: it’s hard for him to think about but it’s all he thinks about. </p><p>I thought the conclusion was perfect, with the children both growing into their dad’s shoes, although it’s worth nothing that mom is consistently as badass and brave as dad. But when you lose someone you love you often want to live up to them somehow because it feels like they’re still there with you when you embody their best qualities. So I get it.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "Some notable passages from today's 3rd Circuit opinion in <em>Fields v. City of Philadelphia</em>, holding that there is a First Amendment right to record police officers in public, written by Circuit Judge <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_L._Ambro\">Thomas L. Ambro</a>:\n\n<blockquote>the District Court focused on whether Plaintiffs had an expressive intent, such as a desire to disseminate the recordings, or to use them to criticize the police, at the moment when they recorded or attempted to record police activity. [...] This reasoning ignores that the value of the recordings may not be immediately obvious, and only after review of them does their worth become apparent. The First Amendment protects actual photos, videos, and recordings, see <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=564+U.S.+786&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,31&amp;case=12960598670321445636&amp;scilh=0\">Brown v. Entm’t Merchants Ass’n, 564 U.S. 786, 790 (2011)</a>, and for this protection to have meaning the Amendment must also protect the act of creating that material.</blockquote>\n\nand\n\n<blockquote>To record what there is the right for the eye to see or the ear to hear corroborates or lays aside subjective impressions for objective facts. Hence to record is to see and hear more accurately. Recordings also facilitate discussion because of the ease in which they can be widely distributed via different forms of media. Accordingly, recording police activity in public falls squarely within the First Amendment right of access to information. As no doubt the press has this right, so does the public.</blockquote>\n\nbut\n\n<blockquote>We do not say that all recording is protected or desirable. The right to record police is not absolute. “[I]t is subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.” <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=622+F.3d+248&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,31&amp;case=16745214870858628586&amp;scilh=0\">Kelly, 622 F.3d at 262</a>; see <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=193+F.3d+177&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,31&amp;case=7674457757070078920&amp;scilh=0\">Whiteland Woods, L.P. v. Twp. of W. Whiteland, 193 F.3d 177, 183 (3d Cir. 1999)</a>. But in public places these restrictions are restrained.</blockquote>\n\nand\n\n<blockquote>Having decided the existence of this First Amendment right, we now turn to whether the officers are entitled to qualified immunity. We conclude they are.</blockquote>\n\nThat last bit is primarily, though not solely, because the 3rd Circuit had not decided such a case as this yet when the incidents in question occurred. Now that the existence of the right to record police in public is \"clearly established,\" the next time a similar case shows up in court, qualified immunity may be off the table.

Another is to fail to refer workers to doctors for proper tests and diagnoses. Each time an injury causes an employee to miss a day of work or to receive medical treatment beyond first aid, the company is required to record it in an OSHA log book. This data is reported each year to the Department of Labor and is used to identify industries with high injury rates—whose facilities will then face increased inspections. An industry that reports low injury rates is less likely to receive scrutiny from OSHA’s overstretched investigators.\n</blockquote>\n\nIf employers can self-report why can't employees?\n\nThe argument against employee reports would be:\n\n<blockquote>\n  Well, employees will inflate injury rates!\n</blockquote>\n\nLet's think about this: employers are already fraudulently <em>minimizing</em> the rates.

Because Dropbox stores its user passwords hashed and salted, that’s technically accurate — it seems that hackers were only able to obtain hashed files of Dropbox user passwords and were unable to crack them. But it does appear that more information was taken from Dropbox than was previously let on, and it’s strange that it’s taken this long for the breach to surface.\n</blockquote>\n\nDon't reuse passwords folks.

In thinking about the ways in which reproductive justice calls for us to respect the right to have a child, not have a child, or parent that child in a safe and healthy environment, the upshot for me is that the reproductive justice paradigm does not demand that outsider families conform to some particular form in order to help dismantle hierarchy.\n</blockquote>\n\nI have thought about this concern since undergrad, where postcolonial literature, feminism and even semiotics courses touched on the nature of othering as an active verb, something done to a group of people.

				"content_text": "<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/16/politics/antonin-scalia-autopsy-death-conspiracy-theories/\">Enough with the conspiracy theories about Justice Scalia's death</a>\n\nI read this earlier today:\n\n<blockquote>\n  \"As a former homicide commander, I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia,\" William O. Ritchie wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday, according to reports. After seeking to cast doubt on the conclusion of the deputy U.S. marshals who responded to a call from the ranch, he added, \"My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nMy gut tells me there is some fishing for attention going on in the head of the former D.C. police officer who said that.\n\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n\nLet's consider this:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why?</li>\n<li>Why??</li>\n<li>Why???</li>\n</ol>\n\nWas it <a href=\"http://blackbag.gawker.com/did-obama-murder-antonin-scalia-the-conspiracy-theorie-1759442785\">a <em>Liberal</em> conspiracy</a> to get President Obama one more lasting decision about the future of United States legal policy?\n\nWas it a \"Conservative\" conspiracy to give Congressional Republicans and presidential candidates something \"meaningful\" <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/us/politics/senator-charles-grassley-hearings-supreme-court-nominee.html\">to \"stand up\" to Obama about</a>?\n\nWas it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Aliens\">Ancient Aliens</a>?\n\nThere was no autopsy, they say! There was a pillow above his head, they say! The President was told long before anyone else, they say (as if the President doesn't get most of the news before everyone else...)!\n\nConspiracy theorists demand: \"What is your <em>proof</em> Scalia wasn't murdered?\"\n\nThese stupid theories remind me of one of the frequent arguments levied against atheists: \"What is your <em>proof</em> that there is no god??\"\n\nWho <em>proved</em> god exists in the first place?\n\n<h2>Pillows</h2>\n\nMany articles note the ranch owner who found Scalia said there was a pillow above his head, and many conspiracy theorists point to this as suspicious. I sleep with a pillow over my head every night, and another one underneath it, using the two to drown out the sounds of an increasingly conspiratorial world so I can maintain my slumber all night long.\n\nNo conspiracy. Just a light sleeper.\n\n<h2>Politics aside</h2>\n\nI disagreed with much of Justice Scalia's Supreme Court jurisprudence but his presence on the Court was invaluable to the development of United States law and the debates from which it springs.\n\nHe articulated his positions in such a way that I (almost always) respected them, even when I found it hard to believe someone so intelligent was seriously asserting them. He was rarely conclusory, giving reasons for his views, and whether you agreed with those reasons or not, that's more than most politicians (and lawyers) usually do.\n\nHis death is a loss, but there are few more certain paths to some sort of immortality than thirty years on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n<em>Photo: Then-nominee Antonin Scalia, right, with President Ronald Reagan in 1986, via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:President_Ronald_Reagan_and_Judge_Antonin_Scalia_confer_in_the_Oval_Office,_July_7,_1986.jpg\">Wikipedia</a></em>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/95446b5c08.jpg\"> \n",

				"content_html": "<p>Dan Goodin reports over at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ars Technica<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the development of technology which can use inaudible frequencies to tie together multiple unconnected devices. He <!-- raw HTML omitted -->explains<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Goodin cites a letter from the Center for Democracy and Technology to the Federal Trade Commission [<!-- raw HTML omitted -->PDF<!-- raw HTML omitted -->] describing the technical aspects of the practice and the privacy implications. I won&rsquo;t repeat what Goodin or CDT have already explained with clarity. Instead, I wanted to talk about the inability of users like us to opt out of cross-device tracking.</p>\n<p>Why don&rsquo;t the companies developing and using these tracking technologies just tell us what they&rsquo;re doing and give us the option to opt out? Obviously, requiring us to opt <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> would be the most honorable and least user-hostile approach. But I&rsquo;ll concede that as being firmly in the &ldquo;never gonna happen&rdquo; column.</p>\n<p>I am open to the possibility that I set up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->straw man<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the next section of this article, so feel free to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->point it out to me<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if that&rsquo;s what you think. Just be constructive.</p>\n<p>Concerns about using a straw man aside, the only logic I can see undergirding the failure to offer an opt-out mechanism is a concern that a large number of users <!-- raw HTML omitted -->would<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in fact opt out. That would obviously reduce or, in a worst-case scenario for tracking companies, eliminate the population of tracked individuals.</p>\n<p>The only problem with that is that it&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bullshit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>We opt in to terms of service and privacy policy all over the web every day without reading a word of them. Projects like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ToS;DR<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TOSback<!-- raw HTML omitted --> aim to make us better informed about what we&rsquo;re agreeing to and how those agreements change over time. They are fascinating and important projects but primarily the domain of geeks like me (and, since you&rsquo;re reading this, possibly you, as well).</p>\n<p>The truth is the overwhelming majority of people click &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Agree&rdquo; or &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; or whatever other button or link gets them to the web content or software they want to use. Here&rsquo;s a quote from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AdWeek<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article published in May 2015<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, citing a survey done by photography website <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ScoopShot<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s only one study, and yes, it was conducted on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SurveyMonkey<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it&rsquo;s a decent sample size. And can you honestly tell me that you or anyone else you know read the terms and policies of the sites and software you use? Probably not.</p>\n<p>Is there any other reason, then, that creepy advertising tracking technology doesn&rsquo;t offer an opt-out, just like the ones we never actually make use of throughout the rest of the web? Yes, I think there is.</p>\n<p>Most websites have terms of service and privacy policies, although they are usually relegated to miniscule links at the very bottom of the website&rsquo;s footer section. The European Union <!-- raw HTML omitted -->requires cookie notifications<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But when is the last time you decided not to use a website like Facebook or the BBC website because you read their policies and didn&rsquo;t consent to them? I&rsquo;ll answer for the overwhelming majority of us: never, ever.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s their ubiquity coupled with the dominant user response of wildly clicking &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; until you get what you came for that makes website policies such a compelling topic of discussion. The companies building the technology that uses inaudible sound to tell advertisers that your phone, computer, television and tablet all belong to the same person can minimize conversation about their products by refusing to present you with an opt-out mechanism.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s that desire to remain invisible and as uncontroversial as possible for as long as possible that motivates them to be so sneaky. One commenter on Goodin&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article <!-- raw HTML omitted -->puts it very well<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It sure is. The reality is that I am one of those weirdos who doesn&rsquo;t care if I&rsquo;m tracked, but I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> care when I&rsquo;m not asked to consent to it. I propose that some privacy-minded geeks more intelligent than I develop some sort of ultrasonic ad-cancelling noise generation software for us to use in our homes and offices to thwart secret ultrasonic cross-device ad tracking.

He <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/beware-of-ads-that-use-inaudible-sound-to-link-your-phone-tv-tablet-and-pc/\">explains</a>:\n\n<blockquote>\n  The ultrasonic pitches are embedded into TV commercials or are played when a user encounters an ad displayed in a computer browser. While the sound can't be heard by the human ear, nearby tablets and smartphones can detect it. When they do, browser cookies can now pair a single user to multiple devices and keep track of what TV commercials the person sees, how long the person watches the ads, and whether the person acts on the ads by doing a Web search or buying a product.\n</blockquote>\n\nGoodin cites a letter from the Center for Democracy and Technology to the Federal Trade Commission [<a href=\"https://cdt.org/files/2015/10/10.16.15-CDT-Cross-Device-Comments.pdf\">PDF</a>] describing the technical aspects of the practice and the privacy implications. I won't repeat what Goodin or CDT have already explained with clarity. Instead, I wanted to talk about the inability of users like us to opt out of cross-device tracking.\n\nWhy don't the companies developing and using these tracking technologies just tell us what they're doing and give us the option to opt out? Obviously, requiring us to opt <em>in</em> would be the most honorable and least user-hostile approach. But I'll concede that as being firmly in the \"never gonna happen\" column.\n\nI am open to the possibility that I set up a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man\">straw man</a> in the next section of this article, so feel free to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/joeross\">point it out to me</a> if that's what you think. Just be constructive.\n\nConcerns about using a straw man aside, the only logic I can see undergirding the failure to offer an opt-out mechanism is a concern that a large number of users <em>would</em> in fact opt out. That would obviously reduce or, in a worst-case scenario for tracking companies, eliminate the population of tracked individuals.\n\nThe only problem with that is that it's <em>bullshit</em>.\n\nWe opt in to terms of service and privacy policy all over the web every day without reading a word of them. Projects like <a href=\"https://tosdr.org/about.html\">ToS;DR</a> and <a href=\"https://tosback.eff.org/web_front_end/\">TOSback</a> aim to make us better informed about what we're agreeing to and how those agreements change over time. They are fascinating and important projects but primarily the domain of geeks like me (and, since you're reading this, possibly you, as well).\n\nThe truth is the overwhelming majority of people click \"Yes\" or \"Agree\" or \"Continue\" or whatever other button or link gets them to the web content or software they want to use. Here's a quote from <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/survey-many-users-never-read-social-networking-terms-of-service-agreements/620843\">an <em>AdWeek</em> article published in May 2015</a>, citing a survey done by photography website <a href=\"https://www.scoopshot.com/\">ScoopShot</a>:\n\n<blockquote>\n  More than 30 percent of the 1,270 survey respondents said they never read the ToS when signing up to a social network. 49.53 percent only read the ToS ‘sometimes,’ and only 17.56 percent of people ‘always’ read the ToS.\n</blockquote>\n\nYes, that's only one study, and yes, it was conducted on <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.net/results/SM-JCDL25J9/\">SurveyMonkey</a>, but it's a decent sample size. And can you honestly tell me that you or anyone else you know read the terms and policies of the sites and software you use? Probably not.\n\nIs there any other reason, then, that creepy advertising tracking technology doesn't offer an opt-out, just like the ones we never actually make use of throughout the rest of the web? Yes, I think there is.\n\nMost websites have terms of service and privacy policies, although they are usually relegated to miniscule links at the very bottom of the website's footer section. The European Union <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications#Cookies\">requires cookie notifications</a>. But when is the last time you decided not to use a website like Facebook or the BBC website because you read their policies and didn't consent to them? I'll answer for the overwhelming majority of us: never, ever.\n\nIt's their ubiquity coupled with the dominant user response of wildly clicking \"Yes\" until you get what you came for that makes website policies such a compelling topic of discussion. The companies building the technology that uses inaudible sound to tell advertisers that your phone, computer, television and tablet all belong to the same person can minimize conversation about their products by refusing to present you with an opt-out mechanism.\n\nIt's that desire to remain invisible and as uncontroversial as possible for as long as possible that motivates them to be so sneaky. One commenter on Goodin's <em>Ars</em> article <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/beware-of-ads-that-use-inaudible-sound-to-link-your-phone-tv-tablet-and-pc/?comments=1&amp;post=30124065#comment-30124065\">puts it very well</a>:\n\n<blockquote>\n  that advertisers keep basing their technological \"progress\" off of malware research and techniques is very telling.\n</blockquote>\n\nIt sure is. The reality is that I am one of those weirdos who doesn't care if I'm tracked, but I <em>do</em> care when I'm not asked to consent to it. I propose that some privacy-minded geeks more intelligent than I develop some sort of ultrasonic ad-cancelling noise generation software for us to use in our homes and offices to thwart secret ultrasonic cross-device ad tracking. You have to take that one and run with it, I'm just an ideas man.\n",

Ghostery doesn’t block ads or any other content by default. That’s too subjective a call.

I plan to hang onto it and will probably stick with it until Purify somehow differentiates itself.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1387\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"576\"]<img src=\"https://joeross1.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/8195a-img_0184.png?w=576&amp;h=1024\" alt=\"Settings screen from Purify, an iOS ad blocker by Chris Aljoudi\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1387\"> Whitelisting screen from Purify, an iOS ad blocker by Chris Aljoudi[/caption]\n\nBut for those of you who haven't yet tried one out, or are still on the fence about which one to use, and haven't yet purchased and installed Peace, or have deleted it since it was pulled from the App Store, I have to recommend <a href=\"https://www.purify-app.com/\">Purify</a>. Yes, it's $3.99, no, that shouldn't stop you from getting it. It has a dead-simple and fast whitelisting option and lets you decide to block images, scripts and fonts as well, although only ads and trackers are blocked by default.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1390\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"264\"]<img src=\"uploads/2024/a03e212599.jpg\" alt=\"ublock, an ad blocker for desktop browsers, by Chris Aljoudi\" width=\"264\" height=\"393\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1390\">ublock, an ad blocker for desktop browsers, by Chris Aljoudi[/caption]\n\nPurify also has the benefit of being developed by <a href=\"https://chrismatic.io/\">Chris Aljoudi</a>, maker of the <a href=\"https://www.ublock.org/\">uBlock extension</a> for desktop browsers. uBlock also has a dead-simple whitelisting option. Aljoudi developed uBlock <a href=\"https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock\">out in the open</a> and it's free, so you can get a good sense of the quality of his work before buying Purify, if my recommendation isn't enough.\n\niOS 9 marks the first time Apple has included content blocking in the mobile operating system, and it almost certainly is part of a larger strategy to squeeze other large companies reliant on advertising models for revenue. But its bound to put pressure on small and medium publishers to clean up their advertising standards or consider alternatives like membership programs or tip jars, used by <a href=\"http://brettterpstra.com/support/\">Brett Terpstra</a>, <a href=\"http://www.loopinsight.com/membership/\"><em>The Loop</em></a>, <a href=\"https://secure.squarespace.com/commerce/donate?donatePageId=544718e3e4b0ffdce4d1bde4\">Katie Floyd</a> and many others, with varying degrees of success.\n\nFor now, I'll keep on blocking the crap and whitelisting the good guys.

Blocking pop-ups was much more incisive: it was easy for legitimate publishers to avoid one narrowly-useful Javascript function to open new windows. But it’s completely reasonable for today’s web readers to be so fed up that they disable all ads, or even all Javascript. Web developers and standards bodies couldn’t be more out of touch with this issue, racing ahead to give browsers and Javascript even more capabilities without adequately addressing the fundamental problems that will drive many people to disable huge chunks of their browser’s functionality.\n</blockquote>\n\nI vascillate between <a href=\"https://www.ghostery.com/en/our-solutions/ghostery-add-on/\">Ghostery</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ublock.org/\">uBlock</a>, but they do the same thing: disable the scripts that power advertisements and tracking on the web. Some sites respect their visitors and present unobtrusive, high-quality advertisements. I whitelist those because, even if I'm unlikely to look at the ads and far <em>less</em> likely to actually click on them, the respect the publisher showed me deserves reciprocation.\n\nBut Arment is right. There's no nice way to say it: publishers with shitty ads won't remain viable much longer in the face of increased user awareness and response. The ability to <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/11/8764437/iphone-adblock-safari-ios-9\">use ad blockers in iOS 9</a> will only accelerate the downfall of sites with shitty ads.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/26de53c316.jpg\"> \n",

But HBO, excepting a bump in mid-April coinciding with the increased promotion of their new HBO Now service, is losing ground to Popcorn Time in worldwide search.\n\nHere is the same type of search volume comparison, but this time zoomed in to the preceding 90 days and including only HBO and Popcorn Time:\n\n<a href=\"//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;q=HBO,+Popcorn+Time&amp;date=today+3-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz&amp;tz&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=700&amp;h=400\">//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;q=HBO,+Popcorn+Time&amp;date=today+3-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz&amp;tz&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=700&amp;h=400</a>\n\nHBO does not have as wide a lead as Netflix, but the time to react to stiff competition is not <em>after</em> that compeitition has matched or overtaken you. For Netflix and HBO, that time is right now. Netflix has massive infrastructure and an increasingly impressive library of original productions. And HBO has NBO Now, uh, now, which unbundles the premium channel from cable subscriptions. These are both good reactions to the rise of competitors, legitimate and otherwise. But those strategies are not enough.\n\nThe takeaway? Popcorn Time has become similar to Anonymous or, albeit a more controversial comparison, Al Qaeda. That is, it is not a single organization answering to a traditional leadership hierarchy. It is a splintered collection of rogue outfits, some more law-respecting than others, none \"in charge.\" It may represent the next step in business strategy companies like Netflix and HBO will need to take to continue their success.\n\nThe person or company that comes up with a way to legally and technically monetize torrent consumption of popular media at scale will be the next Mark Zuckerberg or Google.<sup id=\"fnref-998-1\"><a href=\"#fn-998-1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>\n\nNow, if you will excuse me I am going to go think about how to legally and technically monetize torrent consumption of popular media at scale.\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn-998-1\">\nI hope that, unlike Mark Zuckerberg and Google, they do not premise their business model on the erosion of privacy norms. <a href=\"#fnref-998-1\" rev=\"footnote\">↩</a>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/ae1028aacb.jpg\"> <img src=\"uploads/2024/c29289705a.jpg\"> <img src=\"uploads/2024/12092bc91a.jpg\"> <img src=\"uploads/2024/1331b139b2.jpg\"> \n",

Jeannette Sgt. Donald Johnston saw the photo, depicting the wounded victim in the chair as found by his mother. It also depicted a young man taking a “selfie” with the victim in the background. The photo had the name “MAXWELL” across the top and the young man was identified by Sgt. Johnston as Maxwell Morton.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The inapplicability of words like “ephemeral” and “private” to Snapchat is <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/10/technology/mobile/snapchat-not-private/\" target=\"_blank\">well-documented</a>. But it’s not common knowledge, and this suspect’s use of the app to send photos of the deceased victim, including one of the suspect <em>posing</em> with the decedent, illustrates the consequences of that ignorance.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting side effect of the prevalence of photo sharing apps incorrectly seen as ephemeral or private is the preservation of a photographic record of the crime or its aftermath. It’s safe to say that the selfie in question would damage the defense’s case if introduced at trial. This case involved a third-party recipient of the photos, whose mother volunteered the photos to the police, negating the need to obtain a warrant.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a strange reversal of the Big Brother scenario when defendants preserve and disseminate evidence connecting them to crime. Prosecutors and defense attorneys alike should keep well-informed about popular messaging apps of all kinds. The availability, and perhaps questionable admissibility, of documentary evidence generated by smartphones is not something attorneys can ignore in good faith.</p>\n</div>\n",

Owners, on the other hand, don’t have the legal right to break the digital lock over their own equipment. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act—a 1998 copyright law designed to prevent digital piracy—classifies breaking a technological protection measure over a device’s programming as a breach of copyright. So, it’s entirely possible that changing the engine timing on his own tractor makes a farmer a criminal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s not just “entirely possible,” if he’s circumventing “a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under” copyright law<sup id=\"fnref:p110252799311-1\"><a href=\"p110252799311-1\" rel=\"footnote\" target=\"_blank\">1</a></sup>, he’s committing a crime.</p>\n\n<p>And those folks trading information or even hardware meant to help one another get around the manufacturers’ security measures, they’re criminals, too. The law says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof, that [enables or encourages its use in circumvention].<sup id=\"fnref:p110252799311-2\"><a href=\"p110252799311-2\" rel=\"footnote\" target=\"_blank\">2</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions were poorly drafted, are overbroad, and reflect a lack of understanding by Congress of the specific problems caused by digital copyright infringement and more appropriate solutions. If you’re interested in learning more about the problems caused by the DMCA, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca\" target=\"_blank\">done some great work</a> toward reforming, if not the DMCA itself (yet), its interpretation and implementation.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:p110252799311-1\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title17/html/USCODE-2011-title17-chap12-sec1201.htm\" target=\"_blank\">17 U.S. Code 1201(a)(1)(A)</a>. <a href=\"p110252799311-1\" rev=\"footnote\" target=\"_blank\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn:p110252799311-2\">\n<p><em>Id.</em> at (a)(1)(E)(2)(A) - (C). <a href=\"p110252799311-2\" rev=\"footnote\" target=\"_blank\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

One of the primary legal issues raised by the vote is substantially similar in the U.K. and the U.S.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mitochondrial transfer passes on genetic changes from one generation to another. That raises ethical concerns because any unexpected problems caused by <em>the procedure could affect people who are not yet born, and so cannot give their consent to have the treatment</em>. Mitochondria are not completely understood, and the DNA they hold might affect people’s traits in unknown ways. For that reason, some scientists believe mitochondria should be better understood before the procedures are legalised.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(emphasis added)</p>\n\n<p>The House of Lords takes up the bill later this month and, if they pass it, it will become law in the United Kingdom. U.S. law considers medical treatment without the patient’s consent battery, and the offender can face both criminal and civil liability. Similar liability exists under U.K. law, as well.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is complex because in a way it is the opposite of abortion: medical intervention meant to prevent potentially life-threatening conditions. The patient, in this case the unborn child, will, assuming the procedure is effective to the extent it prevents life-threatening conditions, survive to assert his or her victimhood in the event of adverse consequences.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know the answer here, but I will be watching this story and I’ll write about any updates as they happen.</p>\n</div>\n",

According to a DOJ press release:\n\n<blockquote>\n  Attorney General Holder announced today that the Department of Justice will take the position in litigation that the protection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 extends to claims of discrimination based on an individual’s gender identity, including transgender status. Attorney General Holder informed all Department of Justice component heads and United States Attorneys in a memo that the department will no longer assert that Title VII’s prohibition against discrimination based on sex excludes discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender discrimination, reversing a previous Department of Justice position. Title VII makes it unlawful for employers to discriminate in the employment of an individual “because of such individual’s…sex,” among other protected characteristics.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/12/18/doj-transgender-people-cant-be-discriminated-against-at-work/\" target=\"_blank\">reported the story</a>, saying:\n\n<blockquote>\n  According to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, a survey of 6,450 transgender people in the United States, transgender people experience twice the rate of unemployment as other Americans and are much more likely to live in poverty. Advocates attribute those facts in part to the difficulty transgender people face in finding a job.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Direct antidiscrimination legislation addressing the prejudice so many LGBTQ people face would be much better than the DOJ’s reinterpretation of <a href=\"http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>.

The law will get national and even international attention primarily because of Tim Cook’s name. Without it, the law would have been written about by Alabama press and journalists in surrounding states, and would have been covered by LGBTQ publications.</p>\n\n<p>But this small thing Mr. Cook can do, this simple thing, lends a volume to Pamela Todd’s proposal it may otherwise have lacked. And it’s already worked: I don’t think I’ve ever read a single word about Alabama state law of any kind, despite graduating from law school, becoming a licensed attorney and frequently writing about law in general and LGBTQ legal developments in particular.</p>\n</div>\n",

I’m working on some articles, but until they’re ready to publish I’ll still share the occasional link.</p>\n\n<p>This one is a great article from the American Bar Association’s <em>Law Technology Today</em> blog about getting the most out of <a href=\"http://google.com/scholar\" target=\"_blank\">Google Scholar</a>. Legal research platforms are usually very expensive, so Google’s free alternative is a great way to peruse this stuff.</p>\n\n<p>As a law clerk, I have access to LexisNexis for legal research.

This time, it’s not that technology plays or should play a particular part in the case itself, but that a podcast has shed light on a cold case that may lead to an unexpected outcome.</p>\n\n<p>The podcast’s producers interviewed Deirdre Enright, director of the University of Virginia School of Law’s <a href=\"http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/academics/practical/innocenceclinic.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Innocence Project</a> for <a href=\"http://serialpodcast.org/season-one/7/the-opposite-of-the-prosecution\" target=\"_blank\">Episode 7</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Lindsay Beyerstein reports at the <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The UVA Innocence Project is poised to ask a court to test an old physical evidence recovery kit (PERK) that was used on Lee’s body to test for possible sexual assault in 1999 but was never tested for DNA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The DNA is an issue that might never have come up but for the Serial producers’ interview with Professor Enright. It’s the first instance I’ve heard of where a podcast may directly affect the outcome of a legal case. And considering the defendant, Syed, has already been sentenced to life in prison, any change at all to his sentence, let alone total exoneration, would be unexpected and important.</p>\n\n<p>It implicates a power to uncover truth in cold cases heretofore reserved primarily to outfits like Professor Enright’s. What’s even more compelling to me is that Serial mixes the modern technology of podcasting with the very old style of serial storytelling. The whole thing exposes how, increasingly, the law benefits from ancillary developments in journalism and technology. It’ll be fascinating to hear the ultimate outcome when we get there.</p>\n</div>\n",

An employee noticed suspicious file names while working on the laptop, and notified police. Police arrived at the store and asked the employee to access the files to ascertain whether or not they were actually child pornography. An employee attached Defendant’s hard drive to a Best Buy computer and confirmed the presence of child pornography on the drive.</p>\n\n<p>The failure to obtain a search warrant prior to accessing the files was ultimately fatal to the charges brought against Defendant. The warrantless search was held to violate his Fourth Amendment right to freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. Specifically, the court held “physically attaching another device to its hard drive” was a trespass amounting to an unlawful search under the Fourth Amendment and a similar provision of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>None of the possible <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Exceptions_to_the_warrant_requirement\" target=\"_blank\">exceptions</a> to the warrant requirement were present, so the evidence was suppressed under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusionary_rule\" target=\"_blank\">exclusionary rule</a>. The photographs recovered from Defendant’s laptop were the only evidence in the case, so it was dismissed.</p>\n\n<p>There’s no nice way to say it:</p>\n\n<p>The police killed this case the moment they accessed that hard drive without a warrant. Their rush to obtain evidence allowed a possessor of child pornography to avoid the legal consequences of his crime.</p>\n\n<p>I know law enforcement is a difficult job, and it’s often easier to blog about something after the fact than to make the perfect decision in the field every single time. But hopefully this case resulted in a comprehensive seminar on Fourth Amendment compliance in evidence gathering for the police department involved.</p>\n\n<p>And hopefully the Defendant will be caught again, and when he is, the evidence will be lawfully gathered and the jail sentence very, very long.</p>\n</div>\n",

Her lender, C.A.G. Acceptance of Mesa, Ariz., remotely activated a device in her car’s dashboard that prevented her car from starting. Before she could get back on the road, she had to pay more than $389, money she did not have that morning in March.\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This is as stark an illustration of the intersection of law and technology as I’ve linked to in a while. While the tech can be a blunt instrument in a world of nuance (some borrowers are doing their best, others are surely not), I don’t oppose it. Assuming everyone was aware of the terms of the loan, it’s a valid contract, etc.</p>\n\n<p>But this sentence gave me pause:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\n  Using the GPS technology on the devices, the lenders can also track the cars’ location and movements.\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, there probably isn’t anything illegal about it, assuming a valid contract. But in a world of <a href=\"http://ift.tt/MN2Wgy\" target=\"_blank\">automated license plate scanning</a> and associated geo-behavioral profiling, is a GPS device overkill?</p>\n\n<p>I suppose the business model itself is unnerving. After all, if you need to use a GPS device to manage risk, maybe you shouldn’t be making the loan in the first place. Borrowers using subprime auto loans probably just can’t afford to get a car.</p>\n\n<p>Some drivers volunteer for activity-tracking devices as a way of <a href=\"http://ift.tt/1efPpJW\" target=\"_blank\">qualifying for reduced car insurance premiums</a>. Such people can already afford insurance though, and allow their provider to track their behavior as an added savings.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it’s less the tech involved and more the word “subprime,” which to me invariably suggests a corporation taking advantage of someone who can’t actually afford what they’re getting, and will inevitably default.</p>\n</div>\n",

Instagram users like Nikki steal images of babies and children off the Internet, give them a new name, and claim them as their own. Sometimes they create entire fake families.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The sad thing is there is relatively little protection to be had from the law in situations like this. You may be able to sue someone using your likeness in a commercial venture without your permission, but non-commercial use of the nature described above is rarely protected in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Instagram users should review their privacy settings by reading the company’s help pages about <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/116024195217477/\" target=\"_blank\">controlling your visibility</a> and setting photos and video as <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/448523408565555\" target=\"_blank\">viewable only to approved followers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Keep this in mind, though: even if you set your content as private, sharing a link to a photo or video on a social network like Twitter or Facebook will allow <em>anyone with that link</em> to view it.</p>\n\n<p>People who do steal your photos and pretend they’re your child or your child’s parent are violating Instagram’s <a href=\"http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Service</a>, which prohibits impersonation, among other things (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You must not defame, stalk, bully, abuse, harass, threaten, <strong>impersonate</strong> or intimidate people or entities […]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>Fast Company</em> article to which I link above includes a statement from Instagram that the company does remove the stolen images when users report such activity.</p>\n\n<p>This story is another lesson to be mindful of not only what you share online, but how you share it. After all, a private company like Instagram could simply choose to ignore concerns like these, and users would have no recourse. Social networks can be a rich and vibrant way to stay in touch, but we are all responsible for what and how we share.</p>\n</div>\n",

You literally signed up for it. </p>\n\n<p>Facebook obviously doesn’t charge its users money, but the mere act of creating a profile affirmatively grants the company total access and usage rights over everything you do on the site.

The first is that the most recent episode (embedded below), entitled <a href=\"http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-law/265\" target=\"_blank\">Monkeys, Ducks and Unicorns</a>, discusses the Aereo case as well as a recent Fourth Amendment case about cell phones, both decided by the Supreme Court in June.</p>\n\n<p>The second reason I’m featuring This Week in Law is because I have probably listened to more hours of this podcast than any other. It got me through law school by educating, entertaining and inspiring me, even while I was studying far less interesting areas of the law. The voices of Denise Howell and Evan Brown, in a way that only happens on the internet, more familiar to me than some of my longest friends’ voices.</p>\n\n<p>Subscribe to This Week In Law in <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/this-week-in-law-mp3/id202795271\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"http://pcasts.in/twl\" target=\"_blank\">Pocket Casts</a> or <a href=\"http://feeds.twit.tv/twil.xml\" target=\"_blank\">RSS</a>.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

Consider adding to popular posts some links to less popular but equally valuable content. This will combat the filter bubble and help expose readers to good stuff they may otherwise miss.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Slideshows are a dangerous game. They are almost guaranteed to turn your steady daily traffic into a big spike. If even half your daily visitors go through even half a 20-slide show, you’re doing five times your usual traffic that day. If you’re not careful, you risk becoming known as the slideshow site, instead of the news site.</p>\n<p>If you insist on building slideshows, use myriad internal links to point your slideshow viewers to your substantive content. Better yet, work with in-house or outside developers to automate internal links to archive pages. For example, if you run a site about New York, the first time the name “Michael Bloomberg” appears in an article, your content management system could auto-generate a link to a page listing all articles mentioning his name.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Sorry to mislead you, but I’m only to going to talk about one. Slideshows often have numbers in the headline by definition. That is one explanation for why they’re so popular. People like headlines with numbers, as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quick search for “numbers in headlines”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will illustrate.</p>\n<p>I don’t advocate making every article a list. In fact, that’s a terrible idea, at least for news sites. But it’s worth incorporating numbers into headlines where it doesn’t look forced. For example, instead of “CEOs cite multiple syngeries as key to upcoming merger,” try “3 reasons Hospital 1 and Hospital 2 are merging, straight from the CEOs.”</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Maybe topics clearly within your site’s wheelhouse don’t perform well, no matter how many headlines, reporters or A/B tested tweets you use to produce and market them. This may simply mean the audience for those topics is substantially smaller than your broader audience. Don’t wait for the audience to find you.</p>\n<p>I had great success finding an audience for some very niche stories because I sought it out on Reddit, in web forums, in Google+ Communities, with Twitter hashtags and more. The idea is that there are groups of people who self-select for interest in topics otherwise lacking broad appeal. Those audiences are smaller, but they are also more engaged, so the time spent finding them is worth it.</p>\n<p>These are just examples, and the problems differ from site to site. But I think they explain the value and the limits of metrics in evaluating and improving editorial strategy at digital publications.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

Consider adding to popular posts some links to less popular but equally valuable content. This will combat the filter bubble and help expose readers to good stuff they may otherwise miss.\n\n<h5>The Slideshow Site</h5>\n\nSlideshows are a dangerous game. They are almost guaranteed to turn your steady daily traffic into a big spike. If even half your daily visitors go through even half a 20-slide show, you’re doing five times your usual traffic that day. If you’re not careful, you risk becoming known as the slideshow site, instead of the news site.\n\nIf you insist on building slideshows, use myriad internal links to point your slideshow viewers to your substantive content. Better yet, work with in-house or outside developers to automate internal links to archive pages. For example, if you run a site about New York, the first time the name “Michael Bloomberg” appears in an article, your content management system could auto-generate a link to a page listing all articles mentioning his name.\n\n<h5>10 Things About Headlines You Have to Read to Believe</h5>\n\nSorry to mislead you, but I’m only to going to talk about one. Slideshows often have numbers in the headline by definition. That is one explanation for why they’re so popular. People like headlines with numbers, as a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=numbers+in+headlines&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS590US590&amp;oq=numbers+in+he&amp;aqs=chrome.3.69i57j0j5j0&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-US&amp;espv=1\" target=\"_blank\">quick search for “numbers in headlines”</a> will illustrate.\n\nI don’t advocate making every article a list. In fact, that’s a terrible idea, at least for news sites. But it’s worth incorporating numbers into headlines where it doesn’t look forced. For example, instead of “CEOs cite multiple syngeries as key to upcoming merger,” try “3 reasons Hospital 1 and Hospital 2 are merging, straight from the CEOs.”\n\n<h5>On-point but out of sight</h5>\n\nMaybe topics clearly within your site’s wheelhouse don’t perform well, no matter how many headlines, reporters or A/B tested tweets you use to produce and market them. This may simply mean the audience for those topics is substantially smaller than your broader audience. Don’t wait for the audience to find you.\n\nI had great success finding an audience for some very niche stories because I sought it out on Reddit, in web forums, in Google+ Communities, with Twitter hashtags and more. The idea is that there are groups of people who self-select for interest in topics otherwise lacking broad appeal. Those audiences are smaller, but they are also more engaged, so the time spent finding them is worth it.\n\nThese are just examples, and the problems differ from site to site. But I think they explain the value and the limits of metrics in evaluating and improving editorial strategy at digital publications.\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-p90549983215-1\">\nIf I say metrics are <em>always</em> necessary to make an informed editorial judgement, I omit the occasionally successful-despite-what-the-metrics-suggest, good-old-fashioned gut decision, and I’m not comfortable doing that. <a href=\"p90549983215-1\" rev=\"footnote\" target=\"_blank\">↩</a>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

But on second thought, it would behoove AT&amp;T to stick to it’s “vow,” if for no other reason than to grease the skids for regulatory approval of the deal. Like I <a href=\"/post/84847936626/moves-contradicting-previous-statement-may-share-user\" target=\"_blank\">said about Moves and Facebook</a>, it’s hard to blame a company for seeking growth.</p>\n\n<p>While the FCC’s Open Internet rules have been struck down since they were first imposed in 2010, Comcast still abides by those rules pursuant to requirements <a href=\"http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/nbcuniversal-transaction\" target=\"_blank\">imposed by the FCC</a> on its purchase of NBCUniversal.</p>\n\n<p>Now that those rules have been struck down, and we’re in limbo while a new rules proposal <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/15/5720730/how-to-comment-on-fcc-net-neutrality-proposal\" target=\"_blank\">goes through its comment period</a>, AT&amp;T committing to the Comcast restrictions presumes the FCC will have similar concerns about their purchase of DirecTV. So the worst case scenario for AT&amp;T is that the FCC achieves similar restrictions via the new rules, in which case AT&amp;T is already prepared. And the best case scenario is that the new rules are more lenient than the 2010 rules, and AT&amp;T is even happier.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the only losers here are consumers. While there is some question about whether this consolidation in the connectivity/content space will cause <em>immediate</em> market overlap and thus a significant reduction in local competition, it’s hard to see how things will get better for consumers as a result of this vertical integration over time.</p>\n</div>\n",

But my initial reaction was incredulity.</p>\n<p>After all, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wall Street Journal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reported<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Moves had been downloaded 4 million times. Surely Mark Zuckerberg acquired Moves <!-- raw HTML omitted -->primarily for<!-- raw HTML omitted --> its ever-growing trove of user activity data. Why else?</p>\n<p>But none of the coverage questioned the initial statements, and I figured the companies wouldn’t say it so plainly if it wasn’t true. So I decided to wait and see.</p>\n<p>Well, I’ve waited and seen. The lesson here is that it is wiser to pay attention only to what a company <!-- raw HTML omitted -->does<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not what it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->says<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If it looks like a data grab and smells like a data grab, it’s probably a data grab. Even if, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->especially if<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, someone tells you it isn’t a data grab.</p>\n<p>Facebook deals in data, whether its hundreds of millions of users know it or care about it or not. And Moves would be stupid not to take the money and, more importantly, the resources Facebook can bring to bear on improving the app. So a data grab isn’t a surprise. Perhaps the “no commingling” language was an elegant public relations play meant to minimize privacy concerns in the press. That would seem to have worked: as of this article’s publication I couldn’t find a single story on the change.</p>\n<p>Zuckerberg’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recently stated intent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to grow via the acquisition and development of discreet apps and services raises another interesting issue. To quit Facebook, it may not be enough anymore to, well, quit Facebook. If I closed my Facebook account today, the company could still gather data about me for as long as I use Moves. Facebook has a growing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->list of acquisitions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> under its belt, so that concern is likely to increase with time.</p>\n<p>This example of corporate self-contradiction is a good reminder: Always assume your data is a valuable and transferable commodity in the eyes and on the servers of the apps and services you use. Some people are deterred by that fact, while others are not. There is no right or wrong answer, just a continuum of personal comfort and preference.</p>\n<p>While I wish the companies had been more forthright from the beginning, I won’t stop using Moves.

But Moves’ new privacy policy reverses course.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nFirst, when fitness tracking app Moves was <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/24/facebook-acquires-activity-tracking-app-moves/\" target=\"_blank\">acquired by Facebook</a> in April, it said:\n\n<blockquote>\n  For those of you that use the Moves app – the Moves experience will continue to operate as a standalone app, and there are no plans to change that or commingle data with Facebook.\n</blockquote>\n\nCNET <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-acquires-health-fitness-tracking-app-moves/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> almost identical language from Facebook:\n\n<blockquote>\n  A spokesperson for Facebook confirmed the plans to keep the Moves app standalone and not commingle its data\n</blockquote>\n\nToday, in an updated <a href=\"https://moves-app.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\">privacy policy</a>, Moves said:\n\n<blockquote>\n  We may share information, including personally identifying information, with our Affiliates (companies that are part of our corporate groups of companies, including but not limited to Facebook) to help provide, understand, and improve our Services.\n</blockquote>\n\nI suppose the updated policy doesn’t <em>technically</em> contradict the statements by Moves and Facebook because it’s feasible there were no plans <em>at that time</em> to commingle data with Facebook. But my initial reaction was incredulity.\n\nAfter all, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/04/24/with-app-acquisition-facebook-enters-fitness-tracking-market/?mod=WSJ_WSJ_News_BlogsModule&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> Moves had been downloaded 4 million times. Surely Mark Zuckerberg acquired Moves <em>primarily for</em> its ever-growing trove of user activity data. Why else?\n\nBut none of the coverage questioned the initial statements, and I figured the companies wouldn’t say it so plainly if it wasn’t true. So I decided to wait and see.\n\nWell, I’ve waited and seen. The lesson here is that it is wiser to pay attention only to what a company <em>does</em>, not what it <em>says</em>. If it looks like a data grab and smells like a data grab, it’s probably a data grab. Even if, <em>especially if</em>, someone tells you it isn’t a data grab.\n\nFacebook deals in data, whether its hundreds of millions of users know it or care about it or not. And Moves would be stupid not to take the money and, more importantly, the resources Facebook can bring to bear on improving the app. So a data grab isn’t a surprise. Perhaps the “no commingling” language was an elegant public relations play meant to minimize privacy concerns in the press. That would seem to have worked: as of this article’s publication I couldn’t find a single story on the change.\n\nZuckerberg’s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/technology/the-future-of-facebook-may-not-say-facebook.html\" target=\"_blank\">recently stated intent</a> to grow via the acquisition and development of discreet apps and services raises another interesting issue. To quit Facebook, it may not be enough anymore to, well, quit Facebook. If I closed my Facebook account today, the company could still gather data about me for as long as I use Moves. Facebook has a growing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook\" target=\"_blank\">list of acquisitions</a> under its belt, so that concern is likely to increase with time.\n\nThis example of corporate self-contradiction is a good reminder: Always assume your data is a valuable and transferable commodity in the eyes and on the servers of the apps and services you use. Some people are deterred by that fact, while others are not. There is no right or wrong answer, just a continuum of personal comfort and preference.\n\nWhile I wish the companies had been more forthright from the beginning, I won’t stop using Moves. I have personally always been relatively open in sharing data in exchange for convenience and utility. But that doesn’t mean I’m not alarmed by the increasing difficulty of using the internet and related apps and services for those who disagree with my position on openness.\n\n&lt;\n\np&gt;Share your perspective via email at joe@joeross.me, on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/joeross\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> or in the comments.\n",

But it’s as far from plagiarism as you can get. People read Gruber’s site specifically for his opinion on the news of the day. Most of his readers probably find the newsy bits elsewhere, be it on Twitter or another news site. But Gruber’s take adds value, and that’s why they’re there.</p>\n\n<p>I like to think that’s what I’m doing here, but I suppose only readers like you can decide that.</p>\n</div>\n",

If you don’t believe it can really be that bad, <a href=\"http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2013_14/measures/documents/hb2453_01_0000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">read the PDF</a>.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>It is that bad. Ignorance is one thing, but open hostility like this cannot stand and anyone who supports this bill commits the intellectual equivalent of burning the original Constitution to a pile of ashes.</p>\n\n<p>Let me translate that from fiery liberal anger into constitutional principles:</p>\n\n<p>A law allowing the detrimental differential treatment of a class of persons traditionally subject to invidious discrimination because they belong to that class violates the Equal Protection rights granted by the Constitution as to the federal government in the 5th Amendment and extended as to the States by the 14th Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>Let us quote <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv\" target=\"_blank\">the Good Document itself</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gotta love that 14th Amendment. There’s nothing ambiguous in the juxtaposition of the Kansas bill and the Constitution. You can’t deny someone equal protection of the laws. You can’t tell me I’m not allowed in your hotel because I’m a man. Maybe if it’s a country club. But not a hotel. Or a restaurant. Or a state.</p>\n\n<p>The use of freedom of religion as a pathetic attempt to hide animosity and hatred is a supreme act of collective cowardice by the Kansan legislators who vote for this bill.</p>\n\n<p>It is an un-American as it gets. But the good news is, as one ruling after another makes ever-more-clear, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/13/virginia-same-sex-marriage/5473687/\" target=\"_blank\">you can’t stop history</a>.</p>\n</div>\n",

Michael Hayden, former director of both NSA and the Central Intelligence Agency, said […] judges “are not really in a good position to judge the merits of intelligence collection programs.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s funny, because the very next paragraph cites consistent judicial approval of the program as a defense to its continued use:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>An Obama administration official said that on 35 occasions in the past, 15 separate judges assigned to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court had declared bulk communications of telephone metadata lawful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which one is it? Well, as usual with the law, it’s probably both. Judges are human too, despite what some litigators may say, and their job is to decide.</p>\n\n<p>Whether that decision is sufficiently informed in every case is up for debate, but if the former head of the NSA and the CIA doesn’t think judges are well-equipped to render decisions on intelligence collection programs, it’s curious the Obama administration would rely on that judgment in defending the collection programs. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) should be amended to mandate an intelligence background for all judges appointed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance panel.</p>\n\n<p>As it stands now, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court can <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/07/09/john_roberts_scary_secret_powers/\" target=\"_blank\">quite literally appoint whomever he wants</a> to the FISA court, whether they have any experience in intelligence or not.</p>\n\n<p>How intelligent is that?</p>\n</div>\n",

The trigger man spotted a child approaching the underside of the bridge.\n\nThe sniper, following new orders the company had received in the wake of the two recently detonated IEDs, lined up a shot and took it, instantly killing the child.\n\nFurther invesigation revealed that the bag the child had been carrying was empty.\n\nThis tragic illustration of what has happened and may still happen in Iraq and Afghanistan is not the only story my friend had. There was the eight-year-old boy who approached a patrol of Iraqi army officers and US Marines, begging for water. He quickly triggered a bomb vest he had been wearing under his clothes and took the lives of five servicemen, as well as his own. There was the other young boy who drove a car bomb up to a local school, killing himself and a dozen other children.\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing part of the conversation I had with my friend about these stories was how he told them. We discussed the sad sickness of a war that involves children, but he made clear, in the field, second-guesses are dangerous luxuries.\n\nWe can only wonder, from this side of war, what these situations are doing to men and women who fight them for us. The statistics are daunting, but this is not that kind of article. Making men and women into numbers is part of the problem.\n\nLet’s try to keep in mind, not only on Memorial or Veterans days, what exactly it means to serve your country, and that sometimes, even if someone returns physically unharmed, they may not have survived unscathed.\n\nThey do not confine their service to one or two days a year, and we must not so limit our gratitude. It is a debt we cannot repay, but we must never stop trying.\n\n<em>Image courtesy an anonymous friend of the author, with permission.</em>\n",

I’ve used all of Tumblr’s competitors extensively and I settled on Tumblr because it’s mindfully-designed, community-focused, and dead simple. The lack of ads helped, but more important to me than services with no ads are services that do have ads at least respecting their users enough to have decent ads.</p>\n<p>So.</p>\n<p>Keep ads for The Bachelorette out of my dashboard feed. Please consider presenting users with relevant ads. Scan my blog, the tags i use, the words I like, the stuff I link to. After all, you own it. So look at it. Run it through an algorithm and spit out some sort of value which you can key to a set of sponsored posts that, based on their weighted relevance to my interests and the things I cover on my blog, may actually be interesting to me. This is more palatable to users and more valuable to advertisers than showing me some random woman running around on the beach.</p>\n<p>Over and over again.</p>\n<p>Despite my never clicking it or reblogging it or seeing it without making an angry face and swearing never to watch that goddamn show. This dashboard spam does not bode well for Tumblr’s future at Yahoo, and that makes me sad, because I like Tumblr, and I rather like both of your styles, to the extent I can know anything about them from reading things on the Internet or watching you do interviews.</p>\n<p>You said you wouldn’t fuck this up, but the glut of sponsored posts in my feed tonight about something I’ve never given any corner of the web any reason to think I care about suggests otherwise. Turn it around while you still can.</p>\n<p>Change Yahoo, change Tumblr a bit if you must, but why not change advertising and the typically adversarial relationship between advertisers and target audiences while you’re at it?</p>\n<p>in other words, don’t shove bad ads in our faces. If we wanted that we would turn on the TV or some other medium that can only collect data in really clumsy inaccurate old ways.</p>\n<p>You’ve disrupted plenty of things, why not this?</p>\n<p>If you ever want more advice, get in touch.

True, cross-platform task management would supercharge the service for me, and may even end my Any.do versus Wunderlist <a href=\"http://joeross.me/post/42849599646/evernote-ceo-hints-at-future-task-management#fn:p42849599646-1\" target=\"_blank\">problem</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In related news, Wunderlist has <a href=\"http://www.6wunderkinder.com/blog/wunderlist-for-the-web\" target=\"_blank\">added hashtag support </a>in its web incarnation, and so far I’m actually finding it’s very useful.</p>\n</div>\n",

There is much to look at, and other have done good reporting on it, notably <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/08/one-hospital-charges-8000-another-38000/\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Kliff and Dan Keating at the <em>Washington Post</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/business/hospital-billing-varies-wildly-us-data-shows.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">Barry Meier, Jo Craven McGinty and Julie Creswell at the <em>New York Times</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that hospital pricing practices appear from this data to be arbitrary. I wouldn’t be surprised if pricing flucutated from year to year based on what revenue each hospital brings in. That’s unconscionable, and a failure of the free market in arguably the most important industry. Hospitals and <a style=\"text-decoration:none\" href=\"http://your-pharmacies.com\"><span style=\"color: #333333\">canadian pharmacies</span></a> would do well to get together and establish transparent and ethical best practices for pricing, because the alternative is onerous regluation to ensure they are not gouging insurance companies, government agencies, and individual patients without regard to actual costs.</p>\n</div>\n",

The department assigned an investigator, whose investigation consisted primarily of an offsite interview with Gosnell. The investigator never inspected the facility, questioned other employees, or reviewed any records. Department attorneys chose to accept this incomplete investigation, and dismissed the complaint as unconfirmed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Truly horrifying.</p>\n\n<p>While it’s a loaded topic that deserves more space than I have time these days to give it, suffice it to say that I am against any outright ban on abortion. Note that I placed the word abortion in quotes because the late-term procedures Gosnell did were not what legally can be considered abotions under any current law or jurisprudence: they were murders.</p>\n</div>\n",

IFTTT is truly amazing. One of its most useful functionalities is the ability to send an SMS to the service that triggers IFTTT to do something else. So, you can create a “recipe” that will forward all text messages in which you include a “#t” to another internet service, like an email address. Email addresses are particularly handy because many other services use them, everything from Evernote to Tumblr assigns users an email address so you can send stuff into your account right from your email provider of choice.</p>\n\n<p>That way, an IFTTT recipe can receive a text message and, as long as “#t” appears somewhere in the message (without the quotes), it will send an email to anyone I ask. Some services that let you add content via email assign unique email addresses that can receive email from anyone. They’re secure from spam because the email address is nonsense. Evernote does this.</p>\n\n<p>Others, however, use a universal email address and whitelist each user’s own email as the only one allowed to send stuff to that account. Task management services <a href=\"http://any.do\" target=\"_blank\">Any.do</a> and <a href=\"http://wunderlist.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wunderlist</a> both use this method, allowing registered users to send email to do@any.do and me@wunderlist.com, respectively. If the address you use to send the message is registered, the message subject is added to your account as a task, and the body is included as a note.</p>\n\n<p>Any.do is dedicated to creating the best task management experience on a mobile device, and they’re doing a great job. Wunderlist, while they have great mobile apps, is more focused on combining them with solid native desktop apps on all platforms. While I watch them add and refine features, I’m using them both.</p>\n\n<p>I know, I need to get a life.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/recipes/88932\" target=\"_blank\">this IFTTT recipe adds a task to Any.do via SMS</a>. And <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/recipes/88933\" target=\"_blank\">this IFTTT recipe adds a task to Wunderlist via SMS</a>. You should be able to edit the tag if you want, but I find “#t” is conveniently short, and the recipe will remove it from the final task anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I have a couple more IFTTT recipes to share, so if you’re interested in this stuff, stay tuned.</p>\n",

The <em>students</em> pay, so the <em>schools</em> market. His clients, if the allegations prove true, <em>marketed</em> themselves as producers of very employable law graduates. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that when a <em>law</em> school shares post-graduation employment rates, the <em>law</em> school is referring to <em>legal</em> employment.</p>\n\n<p>My incredulity at Mr. Sullivan’s absurd position does not mean that I’m ignorant of the fact that many students didn’t try very hard to get a job, or didn’t like the jobs they got, or should have known the market for legal jobs is, to put it mildly, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/how-the-job-market-for-law-school-grads-crumbled-and-how-it-could-come-back-to-life/272852/\" target=\"_blank\">in dire straits</a>, and has been for some time now.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, I have little sympathy for people swindled by Mr. Sullivan’s clients’ number games.

First of all, just the decision to take the <a href=\"http://www.lsac.org/\" target=\"_blank\">LSAT</a> is a journey in itself. It requires research, asking the right questions of the right people, preparing for failure and, perhaps most importantly, preparing for success.\nIt’s the success that can be most confusing. After all, if you do poorly on the test the first time, you resolve that you probably didn’t take it seriously enough, or that it was just a bad day. There’s a “choose your own adventure” feel to it. The first time I took the LSAT, my score was <em>embarrassing</em>. The only saving grace was that the average friend and family member has never had any reason to learn the how the test is scored, so they don’t know how poorly I did.</p>\n\n<p>I could have gotten off the train right there. I almost did. I almost decided that maybe it isn’t meant to be. But then I thought about it, and remembered that I don’t think <em>anything</em> is meant to be. That’s the great liberating foundation of my personal moral value system: freedom at the cost of accountability. Things happen to me because (a) I have made a decision that caused them or (b) someone else has made a decision that caused them. Thus, I can <em>decide</em> that I’m not cut out for lawyering, or I can decide that I am, and then act.</p>\n\n<p>So I took it again. And I did better. <em>Much</em> better. Suffice it to say that I am no longer embarrassed, even by my first score, because my second vindicated me. I studied harder, focused more deliberately, and made executive decisions about which questions I could answer well and which ones I could not.</p>\n\n<p>But getting a score you can respect yourself for is only the beginning.</p>\n\n<h2>Decisions, Decisions</h2>\n\n<p>Will you devote all of your time to your studies, subsidizing your living expenses as well as the cost of your education? Or will you retain your current employment, making the (in my opinion) far more daunting commitment to maintain your financial standing and continue to accrue work experience while you submit to the rigor of a legal education?</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, going to school full time looks like the most sensible decision. Everything you have heard about law school is true: it’s <em>hard</em>. It’s not an afterthought, or a hobby. It’s at <em>least</em> as mentally stressful as your job, and probably more. Like any graduate school, every hour of class time requires at least an hour outside the classroom. So, the ability to go to class all day and devote your evenings to study and work is a precious resource.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the economy is (still) bad, and even if previously borrowed loans are deferred while you are in graduate school, there are bills and rent to be paid, not to mention food and (dare I say) the occasional drink. Borrowing money for these expenditures is inadvisable at best. Working through law school is difficult, but, since the evening division is a part-time program, credit requirements are flexible: you must complete a certain amount, but you have summer sessions during which you can earn credit, as well. You can keep earning money, and producing promotable deliverables. But you’ll be spending a few hours a night, a few nights a week, in a classroom. And that’s before you even start your homework. It may be a part-time education, but it’s a second full-time job.</p>\n\n<h2>So why did I choose Temple Law?</h2>\n\n<p>Well, even taking into account the (generous) aid package Drexel offered me, I would have had to borrow more money to cover living expenses than I’ll likely need to borrow to go to Temple. Also, my 401(k) account makes me smile, and cutting it off for a few years would mean less smiles. Finally, I’ve got a good thing going at my current job: good work, good people, good benefits. These are not things to be taken lightly in today’s job market. For every lawyer making $80k right out of school, there are three more at the unemployment office. And we’re talking <em>partners</em> here. People with <em>experience</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I made the commitment to work and go to school at the same time. I want to be confident about it, even arrogant. But the truth is that it’s terrifying. After all, I might not be able to do it. Then what? I don’t know. But I know that it’s what I want, and people do it every day. People with more stressful jobs, people with children. There are really no excuses.</p>\n\n<p>Classes are technically from 6pm to 10pm. I’m going to be in danger of succumbing to my burgeoning caffeine addiction. I’m going to be in danger of burning out. I’m going to be in danger of driving the girlfriend (more) insane (than usual).</p>\n\n<p>But maybe I’ll quit caffeine and start meditating. Or running. Maybe I’ll apply my work ethic to my studies, and develop a schedule that includes class time, study time, and mental stability time. Maybe I’ll do well.</p>\n\n<h2>Closing Argument</h2>\n\n<p>This absurdly long post has served primarily as a “thinking out loud” session for me, in which I’ve tried to express what has been going on in my head as I near the next and most important part of my journey: actually going to law school. But this is the tip of the iceberg. This stuff takes me away mid-conversation at work, puts blank stares on my face while Meg’s talking to me, and keeps me wide awake in bed. It worries me, aggravates me, <em>scares me</em>. This is the stuff I always thought adults had to deal with, the stuff that I got to watch other people figure out while I wrote stories or played my guitar.</p>\n\n<p>Now I’m one of those people. I have a job, investments, credit cards, an actual (and good) credit score. I don’t think I could afford to work a side job and go to school. So it might take me longer to finish, while I take fewer classes. But my sense of financial security is young and, with the exception of some indinspensable help (for which I’ll always be grateful), largely self-wrought. Risking it doesn’t seem right. So wish me luck.</p>\n\n<p>I’m going to need it.</p>\n",

In other words, Aereo could provide its service with one antenna, but it needs to use one for every subscriber. The use of one antenna for <em>all</em> subscribers, as the Second Circuit held in its <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13763893657469687275&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\" target=\"_blank\">2008 <em>Cablevision</em> opinion</a>, would likely constitute an unlawful public performance.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Chin says in his dissent that he isn’t pleased by this technique:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Aereo’s “technology platform” is, however, a sham. The system employs thousands of individual dime-sized antennas, but there is no technologically sound reason to use a multitude of tiny individual antennas rather than one central antenna; indeed, the system is a Rube Goldberg-like contrivance, over-engineered in an attempt to avoid the reach of the Copyright Act and to take advantage of a perceived loophole in the law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Aereo’s technology isn’t an attempt to avoid the reach of the Act. It’s an attempt to comply with the Second Circuit’s own characterization of the Act’s meaning and purpose. The absurdity of the situation arises not from Aereo’s attempt at a “sham,” but from the outdated Copyright Act itself.</p>\n\n<p>A quick glance at the rest of Judge Chen’s dissent suggests he may make some reasonable points distinguishing Aereo from the DVR service at issue in <em>Cablevision</em>, so I’ll withhold my own final thoughts on this case until I’ve read the Aereo opinion through.</p>\n\n<p>But copyright law needs fixing. It was written during a time when the cost of copying was non-trivial, and copies were typically finite and controlled centrally by the rightsholder. There is no longer any non-trivial cost to copying. Whether between servers or from a server to your computer, the internet is nothing more or less than a giant copy-making machine. This doesn’t mean we need to weaken copyright law (although shorter terms would be more in line with copyright’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause\" target=\"_blank\">Constitutional imperative</a>), but we do need to adapt it to the modern world.</p>\n\n<p>Professor David Post, whose copyright class I took at Temple Law, signed an <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/111298508/10-26-12-Brief-of-Amici-Curiae-in-Support-of-Aereo\" target=\"_blank\"><em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> in this case late last year—here’s my <a href=\"http://joeross.me/post/34763954996/professor-david-post-copyright-is-meant-to-benefit-the\" target=\"_blank\">post about it</a>.</p>\n</div>\n",

In fact, monitoring otherwise-harmless civilians probably proves valuable to the renegade nation by illustrating the best means of tricking US netizens into installing backdoor viruses on their systems.</p>\n\n<p>The most important point this article makes, in my view, is that China is playing the long game on cyberespionage efforts. As David Feith reports in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> piece linked to above:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The essence of China’s thinking about cyber warfare is the concept of shi, he says, first introduced in Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War” about 2,500 years ago. The concept’s English translation is debated, but Mr. Thomas subscribes to the rendering of Chinese Gen. Tao Hanzhang, who defines shi as “the strategically advantageous posture before a battle.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They’re not going to take down any infrastructure any time soon, but if and when they want to, their current efforts will probably go a long way to helping them learn how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>This stuff is not just a headline: it’s been happening for some time, is still happening, and is likely only to increase.

Dropbox isn’t a just product (although plenty of people pay for its core sync functionality), nor is it merely a feature (although it can be integrated into many different types of apps and services).</p>\n\n<p>Dropbox is, at its most fundamental level, an <em>infrastructure</em>.

The Dropbox file storage and syncing infrastructure already undergirds the daily workflows of millions of people.</p>\n\n<p>Email is the perfect product to build on that infrastructure.

				"content_text": "<p>Evernote will be just fine, despite Google’s recent announcement of a new note-taking app called Google <a href=\"http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2013/03/google-keep-save-whats-on-your-mind.html\" target=\"_blank\">Keep</a>, currently available for the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/keep/\" target=\"_blank\">web</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>. Keep allows for text, audio, and images to be added to a single notebook and synced between the web and Android devices. You can even add stuff via <a href=\"http://www.google.com/landing/now/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Now</a>. It’s neat, but it’s no Evernote killer.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>The two products cater to very different use cases, and Keep will not be able to replace Evernote for its core customers. Evernote had <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/evernote-in-no-rush-to-make-users-pay-2012-11\" target=\"_blank\">1.5 million premium subscribers in November 2012</a>. At 45$/year, that’s around $67 million annually, and the number of subscribers has been rising for years.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t make them profitable, at least at the moment, but it helps. Coupled with Business accounts and other endeavors, Evernote isn’t worried. For those premium users, who pay because they make the most of Evernote’s vast feature set, Keep won’t be good enough. And I suspect that even if every user of Evernote’s free tier left the product, Evernote would hardly notice from an operational standpoint (if anything, operational costs would decrease).</p>\n\n<p>Instead, makers of task management apps should be concerned. <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Tasks</a> is as neglected as <a href=\"http://google.com/reader\" target=\"_blank\">Google Reader</a> was, and we all know <a href=\"http://joeross.me/post/45306123154/powering-down-google-reader\" target=\"_blank\">what happened to Reader</a>. Keep looks like an elegant upgrade to Google Tasks, and while Evernote has <a href=\"http://joeross.me/post/42849599646/evernote-ceo-hints-at-future-task-management\" target=\"_blank\">hinted at its own task management solution</a>, I don’t think the future of their business will depend on it.</p>\n\n<p>It’s worth remembering: there just aren’t as many zero-sum games in the apps and services spaces as many, especially in the tech press, would have us believe. Design, feature set nuance, and adaptability to users’ current workflow all allow for multiple apps to be successful in the same space. The Keep/Evernote dichotomy is no different.</p>\n\n<p><em>This article was adapted from a comment I left on <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/03/20/google-launches-evernote-rival-keep-for-the-web-android-4-0-and-above/#comment-837271966\" target=\"_blank\">The Next Web’s post about Keep</a></em>.</p>\n",

Now, my favorite Twitter app for Android, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jv.falcon.pro\" target=\"_blank\">Falcon Pro</a>, has hit Twitter’s artificial user limit.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>They have other apps, (like <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jv.falcon\" target=\"_blank\">an incredible widget that is also a fully-functional Twitter client</a>), but they can’t accept any more Falcon Pro users.</p>\n\n<p>Falcon Pro’s left- and right-drawer layout, with an elegant, clutter-free but feature-packed design, won me over instantly. It came out just as I had given up on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotsandlines.carbon\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon for Twitter</a>, a beautiful app nearly dismissed as vaporware as it  faced numerous release setbacks.</p>\n\n<p>Carbon finally came out, and it is very pretty, but Falcon Pro fits my personal Twitter use case best, so Carbon is a close second. You know what isn’t even in the top five? Twitter’s official Android client.</p>\n\n<p>Over 3,000 people have signed a petition to raise Falcon Pro’s limit as of Saturday night, but that’s at Twitter’s absolute discretion, and it would set a bad precedent, so I’m not holding my breath.</p>\n\n<p>But if you tried out Falcon Pro and didn’t like it, you can revoke the app’s access to your Twitter account, thereby freeing up a token for a new user. Redditor <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/classic__schmosby\" target=\"_blank\">classic_schmosby</a> explains in <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/192ppq/falcon_pro_has_reached_its_token_limit/c8kahkz\" target=\"_blank\">this comment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter: You can’t build and maintain a thriving ecosystem with token limits and patronizing blog posts about “building user value.” You will never offer a sufficient variety of apps to please all use cases. Your developer community fosters a massive user base that may not otherwise come to or stay with Twitter, pumping data into your system for you to monetize. Developers get and keep users for you by offering designs, features, and improvements that you cannot provide. Don’t stifle that, celebrate it.</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<h4>Introduction</h4>\n\n<p>I hesitated to change themes because, well, it’s one of those things people do instead of writing. But while my customized version of <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/theme/9601\" target=\"_blank\">Quite Big</a> theme had treated me very well, I hate using Tumblr’s default mobile theme on phones, or seeing my desktop-optimized layout on a tablet. I also had modified Quite Big so much that it started to look a little off to me. I know enough HTML and CSS to avoid breaking sites altogether, but over time my changes had started to give the theme a clunky look. I decided that I needed to find the ultimate theme for me: minimal, useful, and responsive.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<h4>Minimal, Useful, and Responsive</h4>\n\n<p>Some people use minimal themes to keep the focus on their content. Others use minimal themes because they think any content placed within a minimal theme will <em>appear</em> great. I think of myself as the former, and it’s why I’ve been personally trending to more minimal site designs for a long time. I consider the use of a minimal site design focused on content to be a commitment. It commits me to quality, and that’s a great thing.</p>\n\n<p>I also want my website’s design to be useful. I’m particularly annoyed when a theme requires me to scroll down to the footer to see how the author describes the site, what other pages are on it, or how you might contact the site’s purveyor. Give me the things I expect when and where I expect them. Yes, it is <em>absolutely</em> a sense of entitlement, but when you’re writing at a blog, you’re writing for whomever is reading. If most people expect things in a certain place, put them there and get to writing the real stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, most free blogging platforms have automatic mobile layouts, but they’re often global, meaning that all sites on the platform end up looking the same on a phone or whatever device the reader is using. This site is on Tumblr because I got tired of maintaining Wordpress and other self-managed CMS installations. I love Tumblr for its simplicity and its Markdown support, as well as its truly beautiful apps. But their “optimized mobile layout,” while minimal and designed for clarity, feels far too cookie-cutter.</p>\n\n<h4>Vision Quest</h4>\n\n<p>After all, a theme, however minimal, does more than determine post width and font face. It sets the tone for the site. It provides a context in which all of your content is going to be experienced. I think of site design, whether for a blog or a corporate portal, as a form of self-expression. Many people get enough self-expression out of being able to share whatever they want, or looking “professional” or “enterprise,” and to them the theme of their site isn’t important. But I take pride in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>having a vision for how my content should be presented to readers;</li>\n<li>seeking out well-made themes as starting points for that, and</li>\n<li>being able to make customizations that bring the theme I found and the vision I have together</li>\n</ul><p>If you can find a theme or site design that fits your vision out of the box, that’s great. Nothing beats just applying a new theme and getting to the writing part of it all. But if you do need to modify someone else’s design work, it’s important to leave credit somewhere in the theme.</p>\n\n<p><strike>I credit <a href=\"http://idrakimuhamad.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Idraki Muhamad</a>'s <a href=\"http://mnml-theme.tumblr.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">MNML</a> in the footer as well as on my <a href=\"/about\" target=\"_blank\">About</a> page. The changes I’ve made fit the design into my vision, but Mr. Muhamad created the theme.</strike></p>\n\n<p><em>Ed. note: I’ve moved to <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/theme/36900\" target=\"_blank\">Observer</a> by Tumblr designer Zach Sultan since first writing this in January, but the principals still apply, and MNML is an awesome theme.</em></p>\n\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n\n<p>Most people use blogs as a means to an end, usually to share opinions or showcase work. But geeks often see their blog as an end in itself. If your site is a book, its aesthetic and layout are the cover, and unlike many authors, bloggers have full control over it. I take advantage of that, and I encourage others to do the same.</p>\n\n<p>In a world of cloned “default” themes, a site design with a little bit of personal nuance will stick in someone’s mind. You don’t need to use design to scream “I’m DIFFERENT!” but you should use it to politely remind visitors that, you know, you’re different.</p>\n\n<p>Then, all you have to do is write amazing content.</p>\n",

Initially, my iPhone continued to remain in range, meaning that if I was to walk around the office or different rooms in the house, my Mac remained awake and usable. However, if I went outside a range of around 10-15 meters, Keycard did its thing without an issue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m not sure $6.99 is a viable price for 1.0 app whose developers are still perfecting activation range and that is suffering from “random screen locks when the device is still in range,” but it’s a neat concept. I’d find it especially useful in an Apple-focused office environment or a co-working space.

For a year and a half, he had weekly private sessions with Mr. Downing as well as weekly group sessions. He quit, he said, after Mr. Downing had him remove his clothes and touch himself, saying it would help him reconnect with his masculinity. Mr. Goldberg has defended Mr. Downing’s methods as sometimes appropriate for men dealing with body image problems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Golberg and Downing have no license to practice psychology or therapy. They took money from men in exchange for the promise of “curing” their homosexuality. And, as this passage demonstrates, Downing took advantage of at least one young man’s vulnerability.</p>\n\n<p>Deplorable.</p>\n\n<p>Conversion “therapy” is one of religion’s dark arts, with no basis in reality and the primary purpose of enriching cynical snake-oil salesmen by feeding off the self-hatred of confused individuals. No god wants you removing your clothes and touching yourself for a fake “therapist.”</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, the California ban on this absurd abuse of religion only applies to licensed therapists. This would leave “religious counselors” like the scum described in this story able to continue to profit from the desperation of people who can’t live with the thought that their god will hate them if they’re true to who they are.</p>\n\n<p>If you think gay people need to seek healing in the form of getting “un-gayed,” you’ll get no respect from me.</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I don’t know anything about design. I’m a user, and design work on websites made for frequent article consumption should be tailored to user experience. I may come off as arrogant, ignorant, or petty. That’s not my intention. I’m being honest about my thoughts.</em></p>\n\n<hr><p>Engadget has launched a full re-design, something we’ve seen recently with sites like <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Next Web</em></a> and <a href=\"http://readwrite.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Read Write</em></a>. Like those, Engadget’s new look focuses on cross-platform responsiveness, with a bias for tablets. I don’t write about every redesign I see, but Engadget was the first blog I read with dedication, so it has a special place in my geek heart.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>Engadget’s previous design was, as even <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/20/dnp-welcome-to-the-new-and-improved-leaner-and-faster-engadget/\" target=\"_blank\">Editor-in-Chief Tim Stevens puts it</a>, “heavy.” A better description would be clunky, crufty, and stale. I’m only going to mention a few details that are very important to me, instead of describing to you a website that you can just go see for yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TYPOGRAPHY</strong></p>\n\n<p>The new Engadget uses the free Google Web Font <a href=\"http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Oswald\" target=\"_blank\">Oswald</a> for headlines. It feels too narrow, but Engadget is prone to information-rich headlines, so I can understand why they chose it. Full-width article images get a headline overlay on top of the image. Opacity of the overlay increases to 1 when you hover your cursor over the headline text. I wish it went to 1 on hover over the image itself, making it easier to get that readable opaque background behind the article title.</p>\n\n<p>The body font is Georgia (same as this blog you’re reading now). It seems almost too pedestrian for a blog of Engadget’s means, as does the Google Web Font. After all, Engadget  has a budget and a design staff. I find it hard to believe that the best they could do font-wise was a free Google font and Georgia.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, <a href=\"http://theverge.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Verge</em></a> uses Helvetica or Arial, and <a href=\"http://readwrite.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Read Write</em></a> uses mere “sans serif.” These blogs often cater to dedicated fan bases, so page loading speed is important: many readers click between multiple articles in one sitting.</p>\n\n<p>I wish font was larger in articles themselves. Yes, it’s easy to increase the size of the page with a quick CMD + (or CTRL + on Windows), but I definitely consider most of the web just a little small as far as font size. People should be able to sit back and read comfortably.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it’s just me (although I’m told my reading vision is fine), but if I have to lean forward to read a website, I’m having a bad reading experience. This is why I’m a frequent <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Daring Fireball</em></a> reader but I can’t remember the last time I visited the website itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MENUS AND UI</strong></p>\n\n<p>I like the topics bar at the top of the site and the placement of the search field immediately beneath it. Expand the “Topics” item on the far right of the top bar to reveal more specific categories. The spacing is touch target friendly, and I appreciate the lack of some fancy separator character.</p>\n\n<p>I like the banner at the top of the site. I like the loading bar that shows the time-to-change from one featured story to the next. I like the persistent table of contents on longer articles, like the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/20/dnp-welcome-to-the-new-and-improved-leaner-and-faster-engadget/\" target=\"_blank\">redesign announcement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Share buttons are well-placed on both the front page and article pages. Pinterest is an interesting addition to sharing options and one that I don’t see very often on sites of Engadget’s type. I occasionally dive into Pinterest myself to pepper my friends with gadget posts. Maybe Engadget can read my mind…</p>\n\n<p>Probably not, though, otherwise the “Via” and “Source” links would be internalized instead of placed in article footers. I don’t go to Engadget because I think they break <em>every</em> tech news story ever, I go because their opinions on the news interest me. Thus, in-line source linking wouldn’t risk losing me to the source. I’m not sure if I’m the exception or the rule, but something about placing source links in the footer has always bugged me.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t like the sidebar with the headline-over-dimmed-image motif. It works in the main body of the site, but in the sidebar it’s cluttered and incredibly difficult to scan. I want to see “Recent Reviews” and other site content placed above links to the podcasts and other supplementary media. The “Quoted” section includes recent tweets from Engadget authors, but I think this space would be better used for pull-quotes from high-traffic or recent articles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\n\n<p>Engadget’s new design is an improvement over the old one, and they plan still more changes as they settle into the new look. Generally, I think their design direction and that of the big-name tech blogs as a whole is great. Tablet-optimized design built for fingertips instead of cursors leads to less clutter and more negative space. In case you haven’t noticed, that aesthetic tracks well with my own preferences, so it’s encouraging to me and hope it continues. I know these websites are businesses, but at the end of the day the reading experience is absolutely everything, and if things continue down this path, I expect to see even more improvements in the future.</p>\n",

With regard to blogs and forums, particularly, there’s a strong analogy with letter-writing and other modes of communication with the “outside” that are typically allowed.</p>\n\n<p>The plaintiffs, two registered California sex offenders, argue that prohibiting their anonymous speech online “even if it pertains to news, politics, and professional activity, and could not possibly be used to commit a crime” violates the First Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>This looks similar to a case I <a href=\"http://joeross.me/post/33905230393/nebraska-court-strikes-down-restrictions-on-internet\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about in October</a>, where a Nebraska federal court tossed a similar law in that state.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t want sex offenders to have access to children online. But these measures do go too far. Maybe registered sex offenders should be required to access the internet via special software that, while it allows anonymity, prevents access to services and sites that reach children.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, the truth is that these laws apply to people who have otherwise served their time, who are “free” in the legal sense, and who no longer labor under the curtailed liberties of institutional imprisonment. That imprisonment is meant to punish them, but also to keep the public safe, to prevent them from moving through public crowds anonymously.</p>\n\n<p>If we have released them from prison, allowing that physical anonymity once again, by what logic do we eliminate their digital anonymity?</p>\n\n<p>I don’t have an answer, but I suspect the issue will reach the Supreme Court sooner rather than later.</p>\n</div>\n",

His focus, as he points out in his <em>Volokh Conspiracy</em> post, was on the overbroad nature of the statute barring internet use by sex offenders, which he believes, and the <a href=\"http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">United States District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> agreed, was beyond what the First Amendment allows.</p>\n\n<p>Your first thought might be “who cares about a sex offender’s free speech rights?”</p>\n\n<p>The answer, of course, is that the Constitution cares, particularly after they have served prison time and otherwise complied with constitutionally sound penalties for their crimes.</p>\n\n<p>The core of the court’s holding lies in the following passage:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The ban not only restricts the exchange of text between adults; it also restricts the exchange of oral and video communication between adults. Moreover, the ban potentially restricts the targeted offenders from communicating with hundreds of millions and perhaps billions of adults and their companies despite the fact that the communication has nothing whatsoever to do with minors.<sup id=\"fnref:p33905230393-1\"><a href=\"p33905230393-1\" rel=\"footnote\" target=\"_blank\">1</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This looks to me like a well-meaning statute, meant to keep sex offenders away from kids online, that was very poorly drafted. You could achieve the desired goal using far narrower provisions. I hope someone proposes a corrected statute to that effect.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:p33905230393-1\">\n<p>The decision, filed on October 17, is not yet “reported,” but it can be accessed by those with Westlaw access using the cite <em>Doe v.

I’m really impressed by how it looks and the philosophy behind what they did, including empowering an insular team to build it outside of Aol’s larger structure.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Alto looks so well-designed that, if I was in charge at Aol, I probably would have had them launch without much of a mention of Aol at all. It’s unfortunate but true that the Aol brand is really a handicap to anyone trying to do something as bold as redesigning how we use email. Some people may see “Alto, by Aol” and skip it altogether. I almost did.</p>\n\n<p>Alto works with many popular email services, including Gmail, so I’m excited to see how it works. You can request an invite <a href=\"https://login.altomail.com/login/signin?next=http://altomail.com/app/main\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. I’ll write something more in-depth when I get the chance to try it out.</p>\n</div>\n",

Google got hammered by voluminous coverage because, in the minds of the tech press and many consumers, what they do with data <em>matters</em>. Microsoft, on the other hand, is not seen as an important player in the consumer data space. That perception may be inaccurate, particularly with the generally positive reaction to, if not widespread adoption of, <a href=\"http://www.skydrive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SkyDrive</a> and the new <a href=\"http://www.outlook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But it’s there: when it comes to privacy, Google is search and email and Android. Microsoft is, well, not much. Windows 8 and Surface may change that, but no one is holding their breath. In short, this looks like a case in which Microsoft got let less critical press coverage than they may have wanted: people complain about the things that are important to them. The unimportant things get ignored.</p>\n</div>\n",

The common assumption is that immigrants do jobs US citizens don’t want to do. This research would seem to turn those assumptions upside-down: immigrants often do jobs for which US policy, educational institutions, and deeply-ingrained social strictures simply leave our young people unprepared.</p>\n\n<p>My Citizenship and Immigration class meets twice weekly, on Monday and Wednesday evenings. It really is a fascinating class, and offers a broadened perspective on a hot political issue this election season.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I’ve learned from <a href=\"http://www.law.temple.edu/Pages/Faculty/N_Faculty_Spiro_Main.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Peter Spiro</a> (of <a href=\"http://opiniojuris.org/author/peter-spiro/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Opinio Juris</em></a> and much <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=223948\" target=\"_blank\">scholarship</a>), and from research like Mr. Wadhwa’s, is that immigration policy is not as amenable to applause-worthy one-liners as political candidates would prefer it to be.</p>\n\n<p>The angle on Mr. Wadhwa’s recent research, and Mr. Ferenstein’s <em>TechCrunch</em> post, is that immigrant participation in US entrepreneurialism may have peaked already. I wonder, not cynically or rhetorically, but <em>genuinely wonder</em>, whether the US will be able to replace them with adequately-inspired and prepared citizens of its own, and whether the nation wouldn’t benefit from incentivizing continued and increased opportunities for citizens and immigrants alike.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know what that policy direction should look like, but I think it’s worth thinking, and most importantly, talking about.</p>\n</div>\n",

Thanks to the purveyor of <a href=\"http://kaos.am/post/31065995043\" target=\"_blank\">kaos.am</a> for unknowingly alerting me to this classy and subtle way to allow some direct communication without resorting to comments. Find more info on my no-comments policy <a href=\"http://joeross.me/comments\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Second, all of my <a href=\"http://joeross.me/tagged/articles\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> posts now include a “Read Later” button that will send that post to your <a href=\"http://instapaper.com\" target=\"_blank\">Instapaper</a> account. If you don’t have an Instapaper account, you should consider getting one. It’s <a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/subscription\" target=\"_blank\">not free</a>, but it’s worth paying for the knowledge that it won’t “pivot” or become ad-ridden sometime down the road. Instapaper also innovates frequently, doing things like <a href=\"http://david-smith.org/blog/2012/01/13/instapaper-on-the-kindle/\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle integration</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.instapaper.com/post/32233350372\" target=\"_blank\">fonts for vision-impaired readers</a> before anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>Third, I’ve added some more feed options to the site. The original Tumblr feed is still available. However, you can now choose between a master feed including all updates, a links-only feed that only includes the links I share (updated at least once a day), or an articles-only feed that includes only longer articles (updated at least once a week). Find more information <a href=\"http://joeross.me/subscribe\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That’s it. I hope you find at least one of these additions useful. I don’t plan to add to this site very often, as part of the goal in building it was to keep it clean and content-focused.</p>\n",

Citing Times policy, reporters should say no if a source demands, as a condition of an interview, that quotes be submitted afterward to the source or a press aide to review, approve or edit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I first wrote about the quote approval problem when I <a href=\"http://joeross.me/post/31747778284/david-carr-on-quotation-approval\" target=\"_blank\">linked to David Carr’s piece on it</a>. Then I <a href=\"http://joeross.me/post/31863450609/david-hoffman-on-quotation-approval\" target=\"_blank\">expressed my agreement</a> with Temple Law professor David Hoffman, who wrote at <em>Concurring Opinions</em> about the frequency with which experts such as himself are misquoted or taken out of context.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure the <em>Times</em> policy does a very good job of distinguishing between approval by PR folks and approval by subject-matter experts. The former try to approve quotes to control messaging, while the latter try to approve quotes to ensure their opinions on a given issue aren’t manipulated to further a skewed narrative.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t think those two cases can be dealt with in the same policy without explicitly pointing them out and setting up a framework for each one. The <em>Times</em> policy allows for exceptions with senior editorial approval, and that may allow experts like Professor Hoffman to explain that they want to ensure their comments are presented in the manner in which they intend them to be presented. Or, it may not.</p>\n\n<p>Marco Arment <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2012/09/19/quote-approval\" target=\"_blank\">suggested disclosing</a> when quotes have been approved for an article, instead of calling for an unqualified end to the practice. I’m not sure that’s the <em>perfect</em> solution, but I think I prefer Mr. Arment’s policy to the <em>Times</em> policy.</p>\n\n<p>Disclosure makes sense and would show great respect to readers by allowing them to decide whether the reliability of a particular quote is or is not affected by its pre-approval by the source. Experts could ensure accurate representation of their opinions, and readers could be kept in the loop when a communications department has manufactured the CEO’s statement to the paper.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the <em>Times</em> quote policy is nothing less than a good start, but it’s also nothing more.</p>\n",

We’ve still got a long way to go, and to get there we need to make sure that the types of connections that IFTTT enables are aligned with how the original creators want their tools and services to be used.</p>\n  \n  <p>We at IFTTT are big Twitter fans and, like yourself, we’ve gotten a lot of value out of the Recipes that use Twitter Triggers. We’re sad to see them go, but remain excited to build features that work within Twitter’s new policy. Thank you for your support and for understanding these upcoming changes.

This morning, I found that Professor David Hoffman, whose corporate law class I took at Temple Law, had posted his own thoughts at <em>Concurring Opinions</em>.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>Specifically, this part stuck out to me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There’s a simple reason that most sources (including me) ask for quote approval: we don’t trust reporters to avoid making a hash out of our comments, pulling quotes selectively to fit a pre-existing narrative, and consequently turning the source into the reporter’s sock puppet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Professor Hoffman’s reaction illustrates an important distinction that we need to make in thinking about the integrity of quote approval. I think that experts have a right to approve not only their quotes, but the context in which those quotes will appear.</p>\n\n<p>After all, a journalist’s use of an expert extends beyond the quote, and can be honest or manipulative depending on the integrity of the journalist in question. The press <em>seeks</em> quotes from experts like Professor Hoffman, and I believe their seeking creates an obligation to accurately report not only the words but the context.</p>\n\n<p>However, David Carr’s thesis on the problem with quote approval holds true when those approvals are coming from public relations departments or firms, campaigns, or others who actively <em>seek</em> press coverage. The difference is between controlling the narrative (in the case of PR) and ensuring accurate context (in the case of experts).</p>\n</div>\n",

Meanwhile, the damn thing throws a force-close dialogue every couple of hours, stutters whenever I try to switch between apps, and occasionally reboots itself just for fun.</p>\n\n<p>My fiancée has had an iPhone 4 for a little over a year, so I’ve had a lot of time to sit on the couch late at night and compare the two phones (like the unashamed geek one has to be to do such things…). The verdict is clear, quick, and simple: go Android for customization and Gmail (a far bigger point in Android’s favor than non-Gmail users might imagine…) but go iPhone for stability and app availability.</p>\n\n<p>That has been the state of things for some time, and it’s no different with the introduction of the iPhone 5, iOS 6, or Android Jelly Bean.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it’s because I’m 29 this year, but my desire to customize the hell out of my phone is fading fast, especially at the high cost of stability. I’ll always keep an Android phone or two around for playing with custom ROMs, but I need something more refined for my primary phone.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I’ve found on other Android devices that the four-inch display is my preference. The older iPhone displays were too small, and the Galaxy Nexus, at 4.6 inches, is a bit too large. Some people are complaining that iPhone 5 looks the same, just as the 4S looked the same. But it doesn’t: it has a bigger display and a thinner depth, without sacrificing anything in the spec department. That’s change enough for me.</p>\n\n<p>Honan nailed it: iPhone 5 is great and it’s whatever. But it’s stable, app-rich, uniformly-updated whatever. And unless my first experience with it in a store or from a friend’s unit is surprisingly negative, it’s what I’m getting the next time I need a new phone.</p>\n",

I just don’t agree that there is <em>any</em> probable circumstance in which the iPhone 5 marks the beginning of the end of Apple’s dominance. I <em>want</em> him to be right, but I believe it will take <em>action</em> on the part of Apple’s competitors, rather than mere <em>inaction</em> from Cupertino, to catalyze that descent from the pinnacle.</p>\n\n<p>I want to see something truly threaten Apple’s dominance: it would be good for consumers and even good for Apple, potentially motivating just the sort of next-generation innovation everyone wishes we saw with the iPhone 5. But Android is peddled in an ever-changing array of hardware of wildly varying quality, its interface often marred by manufacturer “improvements” and carrier-mandated bloatware, with no cohesive or remotely predictable software upgrade schedule.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, it’s customizable, “open” (depending on how you define the term), and a provider of competitive pressure. In fact, Android, the <em>OS</em>, in its pristine Jelly Bean state on glorious hardware, is functional and gorgeous. But Android, the <em>experience</em> and, for lack of a better word, the <em>brand</em>, is truly a mess.</p>\n\n<p>Then, there is the iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>Apple tried for years to make things people loved. They succeeded. Now they are in the business of making <em>improvements</em> on the things they make that people love. And they’re succeeding there, too.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not they revolutionize TV next, and whether or not they drastically refresh iOS in the next couple of years, I think they’re still comfortably in the middle of their dominance, and at the top of their game.</p>\n",

Or it could be that what you’re trying to optimize for is quantity (quantity of access, of distribution), which can often come at the cost of quality and depth of interaction.  Or like most of us who are successful Americans, we automatically assume that our stance on individual rights and belief in the individualistic survival of the fittest / the elite will rise are “ideal” or “optimal.”.  Another example is our cultural bias towards the “cult of the celebrity.”. And we tend to measure success by economic output.</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is geared toward inhabitants of the Silicon Valley “island” on which so many people become detached from reality, but much of it applies generally to life in a first-world country, as well.</p>\n</div>\n",

There were scientists, foodies, comic book artists, filmmakers, comedians, web designers, indie game and app developers, and many more. The sheer diversity of geekery going on Philadelphia is amazing. But the gathering, and the award ceremony in particular, have become much more than the sum of their parts.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, the first annual Philly Geek Awards proved to the City and its geeks that the Age of Geek is here to stay in Philadelphia. Geek may be the new cool when it comes to pop culture, but there is no shortage of 100% pure geek street-cred in Philly. It’s not a fashion trend (although Philly geeks clean up very well, myself included). It’s also <a href=\"http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/arts-culture/41054-philly-geek-awards-nominees-led-by-girl-geeks\" target=\"_blank\">not a boys’ club</a> (Spoiler alert: Ms. Hightower won 2012 Geek of the Year!).</p>\n\n<p>The first ceremony cemented the presence and importance of this city’s geek community.</p>\n\n<p>It was refreshing.</p>\n\n<p>This year, the second annual Geek Awards proved that Philly’s geeks are not satisfied merely to be recognized. They are building, connecting, and developing communities, online and off, all over Philadelphia and at an unprecedented pace. This time, it was more than refreshing:</p>\n\n<p>It was inspiring.</p>\n\n<p>That’s because what I saw, and what I could feel in the air, was a sense not only of like-mindedness when it comes to community and innovation, but an even stronger sense that we can, and should, work together for a better city.</p>\n\n<p>I realize that by the end of that last sentence, I started to sound like a politician. Maybe that’s okay: with any luck, some of the Geek Awards attendees, or their friends, or their spouses, or their children, will become a politician, or work for one. If anyone can overcome the absurdity of politics, it’s a Philly geek.</p>\n\n<p>Then there are the companies, the publications, the government partnerships, the music records, the software, and more that will come from the massive, wonderful brains of Philly’s geeks.</p>\n\n<p>Enough about the future. What about today?</p>\n\n<p>Every city needs such a perfect way to unite, reward, and inspire its geeks. Only recently has Philly’s true geekery started to find its way into government (a beat covered masterfully by <a href=\"http://technicallyphilly.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Technically Philly</em></a>). There are undoubtedly geeks across America making <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_comic\" target=\"_blank\">rage faces</a> at their city’s website or longing to meet other geeks. Geek Awards are the answer.</p>\n\n<p>The Philly Geek Awards are about what Philly’s geeks, of all types, are doing <em>today</em> to improve their communities, their city, and their world. It’s about people, coming together and <em>making stuff</em>, at art collectives, coworking spaces, and universities all over Philly, <em>right now</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There’s nothing more inspiring than that.</p>\n",

This post isn’t about that story. It’s about the inner story, about a reporter using a copyrighted photo without attribution, and claiming fair use when the photographer realizes it.</p>\n\n<p><em>Summary:</em> Steve Mistler of the <em>Portland Press Herald</em> <a href=\"http://www.pressherald.com/news/husson-let-chaplain-join-events-after-he-quit_2012-08-07.html\" target=\"_blank\">plagiarized</a> a photo by <a href=\"http://lovelikesalt.posterous.com/sure-its-fair-but-is-it-right\" target=\"_blank\">Audrey Slade</a> and when she requested they take it down he told her it was fair use. I think he is wrong, his reporting was solid and didn’t require a photo, he should take the photo down, and he should apologize to Slade for plagiarizing her photo.</p>\n\n<hr><p>Steve Mistler of the <em>Portland Press Herald</em> used a photo taken by Audrey Slade, who worked at Husson University while Carlson was there but didn’t take the photo in her capacity as an employee. Mister didn’t request permission to use Slade’s photo, and he didn’t attribute the photo to her. He found the photo on Slade’s Flickr account, labelled as “All Rights Reserved,” and published it with <a href=\"http://www.pressherald.com/news/husson-let-chaplain-join-events-after-he-quit_2012-08-07.html\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a> about Carlson.</p>\n\n<p>The appropriate course of action was to contact Slade either via contact information on her Flickr profile or via Flickr’s built-in messaging system. If she replied granting permission, run the photo. If she denied permission, or didn’t reply at all, don’t run the photo. Instead, the reporter used the copyrighted photo without permission and later, in an email exchange Slade <a href=\"http://lovelikesalt.posterous.com/sure-its-fair-but-is-it-right\" target=\"_blank\">published on her blog</a>, claimed fair use.</p>\n\n<p>Mistler’s failure to seek out and use Flickr’s messaging system suggests to me that he didn’t <em>want</em> to contact Slade.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not going to write in-depth about fair use, but you can find good basic information at the U.S. <a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html\" target=\"_blank\">Copyright Office</a>, <a href=\"http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/\" target=\"_blank\">Standford University</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>. The <em>Herald</em>'s use of Slade's photo is not, in my educated opinion, fair. The newspaper is a for-profit enterprise, the copyrighted work is a photograph for which false attribution can easily be claimed, the newspaper did not transform the work in any way, and they used it in its entirety.</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Slade sent some very polite messages asking them to take them down, and even offered to handle invoicing them for continued usage (by the way, I think that is wonderful, regardless of whether it would hold up in court). Mistler could have replied asking whether attribution would convince her to allow the newspaper’s continued publication of the photo on their website. Slade probably would have said no, but it would have demonstrated that Mistler was aware of his mistake. Instead, he gave Slade two justifications for his perfunctory infringement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(1) We could not, by deadline, determine who the photo belonged to, and (2) we ultimately decided it was in the public’s interest to publish them. The story was, in essence, about the evidence that Rev. Carlson was still partaking in Husson activities for years after supposedly being told he was no longer welcome.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the photo <em>proved</em> that claim, Mistler’s reasoning goes, so it <em>had</em> to be in the article. Except Mistler got the former President of the University to admit to the allegations in the article, a far more powerful confirmation than a plagiarized, undated photo.</p>\n\n<p>That was the wrong answer, legally and ethically.</p>\n\n<p>Now Slade has published the email addresses of several <em>Herald</em> employees (all, I think, publicly available anyway), and a commenter has posted some phone numbers (one of which is a cell phone number and likely <em>not</em> meant to be public).</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t my photo they used without permission as part of a for-profit enterprise, but I can say that if it was, this whole thing would be more about principle than money or the law: be authentic with readers and respectful of sources and copyright holders.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, there was no fair use in this situation, and there was no <em>need</em> for the “unfair” use in the first place because there was real reporting behind the story. Hopefully, Mistler and the <em>Herald</em> will do the right thing and remove that photo, preferably adding an apology to Slade and their readers at the bottom of the article for the previous use of an unlicensed photo.</p>\n",

She is right; I should have focused on wanting her take on what I describe below as the interesting bits and not on her revision. She also told me I should have asked her. She is right about that, too. I stand by my wanting some analysis of the areas I mention below where Mayer’s memo departs from PR speak, but to the extent that my post appeared to question Ms. Swisher’s integrity, I am sorry._</p>\n\n<hr><p>Kara Swisher, <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120719/yes-keep-moving-marissa-mayers-first-memo-to-yahoos-natch/\" target=\"_blank\">writing at <em>All Things D</em></a> about new Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer’s recent memo to employees:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I took that to heart in tracking down this do-not-forward (oops) memo —- which I changed around &gt; a bit to thwart those who try to stop me from getting these emails via tricky computer programs […]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Changed around a bit” to what extent? Does that diminish or eliminate the value, if any, of the memo to readers? Was there any value to readers to begin with? My answers are probably “yes” and “no” respectively.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not the only one thinking these things, <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120719/yes-keep-moving-marissa-mayers-first-memo-to-yahoos-natch/#comment-593020059\" target=\"_blank\">some</a> commenters <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120719/yes-keep-moving-marissa-mayers-first-memo-to-yahoos-natch/#comment-593127389\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> the same questions. I think Ms. Swisher should have analyzed the interesting parts of the memo, posting little or none of the actual text. It would have been better use of her knowledge and skills, and would have been more valuable to readers.</p>\n\n<p>The memo itself is nothing special. I can summarize it as “I’m happy to be here, I think Yahoo! is great, I have big plans, but don’t stop doing what you’re doing (unless you hear otherwise) until I learn more about the company’s management culture and direction.”</p>\n\n<p>But Ms. Swisher’s casual mention that she edited it gives me pause. It’s not exactly a sensitive diplomatic report, but mysterious edits by a journalist to a document originally written by the subject of the article make me uneasy.</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Swisher is laudably dogged about disclosing her spouse’s role as an executive at Google. There is a link to her <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/about/kara-swisher/ethics/\" target=\"_blank\">disclosure and ethics policy</a> at the bottom of all her articles. That’s why this offhand mention of memo-revision reads as out of place to me.</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Swisher could have published the unedited version of the memo as an image, likely thwarting any “tricky computer programs” aimed at preventing her future access to such internal emails in the future. Alternatively, she could have simnply written about the bits that weren’t cliche corporate-speak.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Ms. Mayer said in the memo that “While I have some ideas, I need to develop a more informed perspective before making strategy or direction changes.” That suggests the pace of change at Yahoo! under her leadership may initially be slower than observers would like, but will likely accelerate as she soaks up institutional knowledge about how the company functions.</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting bit says “Please don’t stop. If you have questions or concerns about whether to continue or not, please ask. However, with the exception of a few things that might heavily constrain us in the future, the answer is most likely: Yes, keep moving.” What is going on at Yahoo! right now that “might heavily constrain” them in the future if employees don’t pull the plug?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Ms. Mayer said “We will continue to invest in talent, so we can produce the most compelling and exciting user experiences anywhere.” That tracks with <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/dearinternet\" target=\"_blank\">the Flickr team’s response</a> to <a href=\"http://dearmarissamayer.com\" target=\"_blank\">dearmarissamayer.com</a>, asking people to apply for jobs there.</p>\n\n<p>But does Ms. Mayer’s comment suggest that Yahoo! will be ramping up compensation and benefits, going on a hiring and expansion spree to bet the company on a new army of innovators, or just building out the kind of infrastructure and marketing that will make current employees proud to work there again?</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Swisher is a journalist and I am not a journalist. She is talented and successful, and no doubt has a better editorial sensibility (or at least a more refined one) than I do. But I can’t help thinking that a breakdown of the memo’s telling points would have been more worthy of her efforts and our reading time than posting it in its entirety with some unknown edits.</p>\n",

If you don’t understand why I turned off comments here, read his <a href=\"http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/\" target=\"_blank\">initial post</a> and his <a href=\"http://mattgemmell.com/2012/01/03/comments-still-off/\" target=\"_blank\">follow-up</a>.</p>\n\n<p>MG Sielger, a general partner at <a href=\"http://www.crunchfund.com\" target=\"_blank\">CrunchFund</a>, a columnist at <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/author/mg-siegler/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, and purveyor of <a href=\"http://parislemon.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>parislemon</em></a> and <a href=\"http://massivegreatness.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Massive Greatness</em></a>, chimed in on Gemmell’s posts with some thoughts of his own.

I’m posting <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_fiction\" target=\"_blank\">flash fiction</a> there, because I love to write it and it’s the best I can do length-wise until I finish my JD in December (a semester early, if you’re counting, which I am … <em>pats self on back</em>).

My first short story was a survival tale about a man’s struggle in the wilderness. Alas, I can’t find it, but I wrote it in high school and I remember being <em>super</em> proud of it. Survival? Wilderness? Sold!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I wrote another story in college, call <em>Three Days</em>, which you can get for free <a href=\"http://leanpub.com/threedays\" target=\"_blank\">in eBook format at Leanpub</a>.

Of course, it won’t kill me to hear from you even if you <em>did</em> like it, but constructive criticism is wonderful.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, I’m one of those obnoxious people who doesn’t <em>mind</em> telling you I’m in law school, and working full time, and kind of a big deal because of all that. The bottom line is, though, that I never have much time to write, the little time I <em>do</em> have I use mostly to write about tech news and law stuff, and I have <em>no</em> time at all to edit. So I’ve been hoarding all these little scenes of mine, sometimes for years. That hoarding, for better or worse, has come to an end.</p>\n\n<p>As of the publication of this post, I’ve already put up two scenes, <a href=\"http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/26915282022/carnival-time\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Carnival Time</em></a> and <a href=\"http://fictionbyjoeross.tumblr.com/post/27079728829/the-deaths-of-dolly-dignan\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Deaths of Dolly Dignan</em></a>.

When Flipboard becomes that, I would love to reengage and reinvigorate our product. Until then, we have to wait and see and not allow intermediaries to build their own platforms without direct monetizable benefit back to us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is somewhere between a rock and a hard place. People who consume solely through Flipboard — a group I suspect is growing all the time — might not bother clicking through. The friction meant to induce users to view Wired.com might end up dramatically cutting the number of folks reading Wired’s content. I don’t know what the right answer is, but I don’t think it’s “teaser” sentences.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>The ad experience on mobile is already dismal for the user — I only interact with mobile ads by accident. There must be a better way. I know <em>Wired</em> and other content creators need viable revenue streams, and that traditionally the primary stream has been advertising.</p>\n\n<p>But the web, particularly the mobile web, doesn’t even allow for the glossy full-pagers that magazines do. Those full-pagers can be compelling, and what’s more, they can be blended with the magazine itself.</p>\n\n<p>A glossy full-page ad about the newest gaming laptop would be well-received in an issue focusing on gaming hardware, consoles, and next-generation systems. The same connection is much harder to make on mobile, where space is as precious to the publisher selling the ads as it is to the reader teaching himself how to visually avoid them. Flipboard is so popular because it involves us in the content consumption beyond merely staring at a screen. It’s subtle, but that flip is oddly engaging.</p>\n\n<p>If the platform won’t accomodate your advertising, it’s time for your advertising to accomodate the platform. A headline and a single teaser sentence make for bad user experience: either find a way to participate in full, or get out altogether. Half-measures suggest a lack of innovation and a willingness to make user experience secondary to revenue, when user experience is what brings (and keeps) the eyeballs that bring (and keep) the advertising dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Why can’t an advertisement be “Flipboard-ized?” Why not include in <em>Wired</em>'s Flipboard stream an article entitled “Ad: Alienware M18x Moves Gaming Laptops into the 21st Century,” accompanied by stunning images of the inner workings and outer design of the machine? This offers the same “unified experience” of which a full-page print magazine ad is capable, but maintains the user experience that makes Flipboard so popular.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated 8:30pm:</strong>  <em>Alexia Tsotsis <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/25/die-less-slow/\" target=\"_blank\">briefly interviewed Flipboard CEO Mike McCue</a> about the New York Times’ integration into Flipboard. All digital subscribers to the Times can access the newspaper’s full array of online content via Flipboard. More interesting is the fact that the paper’s Flipboard content will also include advertisements described by McCue as “full page, print style advertising.” I respectfully request some credit for at least independently coming up with the model used by the Flipboard/NYT partnership (I somehow missed Tsotsis’ headline while writing this post), but I’m happy to see someone is at least trying it out.</em></p>\n\n<p>Something like this seems to be working for Facebook on mobile, according <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/facebook-mobile-ads/\" target=\"_blank\">a story by Josh Constine at <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. Facebook’s formidable <del>data farm</del> social network struggled to find a viable advertising solution to massive uptake in mobile use, and they appear to be on to something.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe organic inline advertising isn’t the solution for every mobile advertising problem, but it’s an example of the fact that this problem is solvable. My Flipboard/<em>Wired</em> suggestion probably has weaknesses, but let’s have that conversation. Let’s argue about how the interests of publishers, users, and adverstisers, for all of their apparent conflict, often converge on great value propositions: content <em>and</em> ads that are well-built, well-tailored, and complimentary to one another, rather than shoe-horned next to one another in a way that damages the user experience and decreases all forms of value for everyone.</p>\n",

They might make decent money in the long run by selling subscriptions. However, this limited availability also breeds pirates, and one has to wonder how easy it is to convert these people to subscriptions once they have experienced BitTorrent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>TorrentFreak</em> is unabashedly pro-torrent and, some might argue, pro-piracy if necessary. And they don’t exactly divulge great detail on their methodology for determining downloads and viewership. But, let’s assume for the sake of a blog post that their numbers are accurate.</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> pulled an estimated 4.2 million legitimate (read: cable-subscribed) viewers per episode <em>and</em> 3.9 million illegal torrent downloads per episode during its second season.

I don’t think you need to massage the numbers, though:</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p><strong>When legitimate and illegitimate viewership are nearly or actually equal, the market has spoken.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This isn’t about prognostication. There is, at this very moment, an untapped market that rivals the current market, and HBO and other premium television content creators are ignoring it in favor of the legacy model. But maintaining cable deals is a short-term no-brainer for HBO. My own anecodtal market study turns up many torrent-happy people who assure me without blinking that they would pay for HBO every month. I don’t know what the reality would look like, but things are getting interesting.</p>\n\n<p>As you may know, I’m not very good at math, but just for fun:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3.8 million illegal downloaders (according to <em>TorrentFreak</em>);  </li>\n<li>divided by 2 (assuming only half would ever pay);  </li>\n<li>multiplied by $20 (per month);  </li>\n<li>multiplied by 12 (months in a year);  </li>\n<li>equals <strong>$456 million</strong> (that’s almost <em>half a billion dollars</em>)</li>\n</ul><p>Yes, those numbers are dubious, but the exercise is still indicative that there is something going on here. Does HBO pull more than half a billion dollars from its current cable deals? I don’t know. If so, I suppose an independent subscription model still doesn’t make sense.

Their website is a Wordpress installation. That’s fine for weblogs of note, like this one, but unless you’ve hired a solid designer and/or developer, Wordpress probably won’t cut it for a publishing website.</p>\n\n<p>The company fumbles even worse in basing the majority of the site’s content on Amazon API calls. Amazon has presumably updated something in their API since Superior Formatting Publishing (really, two -ing words in a row?) because most of the site says only “Whoops, looks like there was a problem get the book data from Amazon. Please try again in a moment” or simply “Amazon API Error.”</p>\n\n<p>\"Philip\" makes the point that \"the ease with which anyone can commit such jackassetry with an ebook and a simple, stupid \"find and replace\" function. He says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It makes one wary of the integrity of any digital version of not only War and Peace…but any e-book.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He’s right. Sure, people could always publish altered versions of a text in the past, but it’s far easier to do with digital content than the paper stuff. This instance involves what looks like a very low-budget “publisher,” but there are many such publishers out there, often with cut-rate prices.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder how many others are find-and-replacing classic works of literature.  Are all such changes merely stupid, like changing “kindle” to “Nook” in the hopes (I assume) of avoiding some automated removal from the Nook store? Or are there people out there making the dangerous, destructive changes about which Philip opines?</p>\n\n<p>Apple <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/apple-publishers-expressed-varying-degrees-of-unhappiness-with-amazon/\" target=\"_blank\">still faces legal action</a> from multiple angles on the ebook front, and most big publishers and sellers know that this is still a nascent market.</p>\n\n<p>But that’s what worries me: will the continued growth of the legitimate ebook publishing market mean the continued growth of D-list wannabes like Superior Formatting Publishing? How can we address the potential for the sale of covertly-altered literature? Is it something for the Federal Trade Commission to look into, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/apple-publishers-expressed-varying-degrees-of-unhappiness-with-amazon/\" target=\"_blank\">as they did with blogger endorsements</a>?</p>\n\n<p>I’m always wary of increased government regulation as long as there’s a way for the market to take care of itself, but I fear there may always be a market for dirt-cheap ebook editions of literary works, sold with or without the right authorization (public domain, licensing, etc.), and with or without the text as it was actually written by the author.</p>\n\n<p>We should all be careful and discerning about which publishers we go to for ebook editions of the books we want to buy.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://futureoftheinternet.org/war-and-nookd\" target=\"_blank\">Hat -tip</a> to Professor Zittrain, on whose site I first read about this</em></p>\n",

I have no “official” user experience training, but both of my reasons might be considered UX critiques:</p>\n\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n\n<p>First, Facebook login suggests an interest in reducing friction, but my experience was anything but smooth. The So.cl page offers to let you <em>sign in</em>, so I tried to sign in with my personal email address but was told that address wasn’t connected to a registered Windows Live account. So I tried to register the same email address with Windows Live. Then, I was told it was already connected to a Windows Live account. I registered a different email address as a new Windows Live account and then got a landing page saying they’d send me an invitation ASAP. So much for signing in.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook has its claws in  Microsoft’s little social experiment, and it’s probably <em>profoundly</em> easier to use than Microsoft’s own sign-up/in process. Unfortunately, anyone who doesn’t have a Facebook account must brave Microsoft’s abysmal Windows Live process. No third way. This is a classic case of fail, and Danny Sullivan’s experience, which he wrote about at his <a href=\"http://marketingland.com/microsoft-launches-so-cl-social-network-a-quick-look-12499\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Marketing Land</em></a> website, suggests the problems I had trying to get into the damn thing only continue as you dig deeper.</p>\n\n<p>Second, Microsoft did stuff it didn’t need to waste time doing: creating a stand-alone site and allowing users to: make “rich” posts (read: blog), “riff” on other posts (read: reblog, a la Tumblr), and conduct “video parties” (read: Google Hangouts, but with less features).</p>\n\n<p>As usual, I have some unsolicited advice for a massive technology corporation:</p>\n\n<p>First, let users sign up with an email address. If you want to make that email address automatically a new Windows Live account, fine, but don’t ask for ZIP code and gender while you do it. Don’t use multiple redirects to sign-up stages, either. Make it <em>simple</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Second, just integrate the experiment into <a href=\"http://bing.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bing.com</a> itself, which looks better every time I visit it. Show users a very prominent one-time explanation and allow interested folks to opt into the experiment. Then, make the So.cl bits a minimal but eye-catching and <em>useful</em> sub-component of each search result or something. <em>Anything</em> but a distinct site. If it feels like a new feature, it’s not as off-putting as a stand-alone site, which can feel like a new hungry content monster users are expected to feed.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft has impressed many people with their design direction on Bing, as well as Windows 8 and Windows Phone (aside from the unfortunate fact that we’re still calling the last two things “Windows” at all). Simple user experience stuff like this though shows they still have much room for improvement.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, one of my favorite user experience designs is <a href=\"http://www.ifttt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ifttt</a>. Show us what you can help us do <em>and how to do it</em> in the same step. That, to me, is an epic UX win.</p>\n",

This way it’s easy to share and discuss your broadcast after it’s over.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now none of this is really new. Sites like Justin.tv and Ustream, among many others, have been doing this stuff for a long time. But those sites built their communities on top of their streaming services. What interests me about Hangouts On Air is that Google is building their streaming service on top of their community.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, one typically had to know about Ustream and similar services in order to seek them out and take advantage of what they offer. Google, on the other hand, is making the same technology available to myriad people who otherwise would never have considered whether or not they want to do a live video meeting/chat/interview/podcast. And if the functionality is baked into the Google+ apps for Android, users of that mobile OS won’t even need to download an additional app.</p>\n\n<p>I think that’s awesome. But I also know it comes with dangers. It’s an opportunity for, at best, loads more noise in Google+ and other social networking feeds as people experiment with this stuff. At worst, for users, it’s a great way to produce and disseminate spam, hate, and other assorted creepiness. At worst, for Google, it won’t get any traction at all outside the Google+ fan club. Maybe it will live and die inside Google+, only coming to the attention of non-Plussers when Google decides to shove the Plus platform in peoples’ faces. But Hangouts is built with YouTube technology, and no one should doubt the potential for anything with that kind of foundation.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, there is an interesting tension here between Google and Hangouts On Air and Microsoft’s Skype. Right now, podcasting heavyweights like the <a href=\"http://twit.tv/\" target=\"_blank\">TWiT Network</a> rely heavily on Skype for much of their production. The video-calling software, however, is notoriously prone to dropped calls and “Cyloning”—breakdowns in audio and video quality. If Hangouts On Air can avoid those issues, it may become a viable alternative to Skype for those kinds of use cases.</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, Hangouts On Air puts Google on par with Ustream and others in the world of livestreaming news. Google can now function as a platform not only for the uploading and sharing of live video of political speeches, riots, and dispatches from convention floors, but for the distribution of that video content as it happens.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sure I can’t predict all the implications Hangouts On Air will have down the road. But even if it doesn’t become wildly popular, it signals that Google is not content to make life searchable after the fact. They want to make it watchable, and interactive, as conversations happen.</p>\n",

There won’t be many images, because finding images for posts has been a distraction for me and I want to focus on what I’m saying. </li>\n<li>My new blog won’t include <a href=\"http://joeross.posterous.com/tag/pets\" target=\"_self\">photos of my pets</a>, <a href=\"http://joeross.posterous.com/tag/gaming\" target=\"_self\">thoughts about gaming</a> (unless there’s a legal or new-tech angle), or <a href=\"http://joeross.posterous.com/tag/food\" target=\"_self\">posts about food</a>. That kind of stuff will live at <a href=\"http://joeross.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\">my Tumblr</a>. </li>\n<li>I will be importing relevant posts from my Posterous blog to my new blog over the next several weeks. I won’t post links to those on the Posterous, since that’s where they came from. </li>\n<li>I will maintain my Posterous blog for as long as Posterous maintains their service. </li>\n<li>There are at least thirty folks subscribed to my Posterous blog’s RSS feed. Thanks for that! But my new feed is <a href=\"http://joeross.me/feed\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, so update your reader. The feed will remain full-content. </li>\n<li>I’m excited to write more during the summer due to a lighter course load, and I hope you like the new site.</li>\n</ol><p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Joe</p>\n",
